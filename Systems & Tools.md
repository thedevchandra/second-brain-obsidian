# Systems & Tools

## Standard of Excellence
Maintain a lean, integrated system where Obsidian handles thinking/knowledge and Notion handles databases/project management. Clear boundaries, minimal duplication.

## System Architecture

### Obsidian Second Brain (This Vault)
**Purpose:** Thinking, learning, knowledge, personal reflection

**What lives here:**
- Daily notes and journal entries
- Meeting notes with people
- Book notes and article clippings
- Research and learning notes
- Evergreen notes (concepts, principles)
- Areas of responsibility
- Small projects with mostly notes
- Personal reflections and thinking

### Notion Workspace
**Purpose:** Databases, structured project management, tracking

**What lives there:**
- Project management databases
- Reading lists and book database
- Habit trackers
- CRM / People database
- Goal tracking with progress charts
- Team collaboration spaces
- Complex projects with multiple people

## Integration Points

### Linking Between Systems

**From Obsidian → Notion:**
```markdown
Project details in Notion: [Project Name](https://notion.so/page-id)
```

**From Notion → Obsidian:**
- Add note: "Thinking notes in Obsidian vault: [[Note Name]]"

### Current Active Notion Databases

#### Projects Database
- URL: [Add your Notion projects database URL]
- Use: Project management, task tracking, timeline views
- When to reference: Link from project notes in Obsidian

#### Reading List
- URL: [Add your Notion reading list URL]
- Use: Track books to read, reading progress, ratings
- When to reference: Create detailed book notes in Obsidian, link to Notion entry

#### Habit Tracker
- URL: [Add your Notion habit tracker URL]
- Use: Daily habit checking, streak tracking, analytics
- When to reference: Reflect on habit insights in daily notes

#### [Add your other databases]
- URL:
- Use:
- When to reference:

## Decision Framework

When creating something new, ask:

### Use Obsidian if:
- ✓ It's primarily text and thinking
- ✓ You'll want to link it to many other notes
- ✓ It's personal knowledge or reflection
- ✓ You want to find it via search and backlinks
- ✓ It's part of your "thinking process"

### Use Notion if:
- ✓ It needs database properties and views
- ✓ Multiple people need to collaborate
- ✓ You want charts, progress bars, or formulas
- ✓ It's tracking/logging oriented
- ✓ It needs complex filtering and sorting

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario: Reading a book**
- ✅ Notion: Track in reading list database (status, rating, genre)
- ✅ Obsidian: Write detailed notes about key concepts
- 🔗 Link: Obsidian note links to Notion database entry

**Scenario: Running a project**
- ✅ Notion: Project management (tasks, timeline, team)
- ✅ Obsidian: Project thinking, decisions, meeting notes
- 🔗 Link: Obsidian project note links to Notion workspace

**Scenario: Learning a topic**
- ✅ Obsidian: All notes, research, evergreen concepts
- ✅ Notion: Course tracker database (if tracking multiple courses)
- 🔗 Link: Obsidian notes link to course entry

## Current Areas Using Hybrid Approach

### [[Professional Development]]
- **Obsidian:** Career reflections, skill learning notes, networking people notes
- **Notion:** Job applications tracker, skills checklist, course progress
- **Integration:** Weekly review in Obsidian, check Notion trackers

### [[Personal Finance]]
- **Obsidian:** Financial goals, investment research, money mindset notes
- **Notion:** Budget tracker, expense categories, net worth charts
- **Integration:** Monthly financial review note in Obsidian, pull data from Notion

### [[Health & Fitness]]
- **Obsidian:** Workout reflections, nutrition research, health insights
- **Notion:** Habit tracker, workout log, meal planning database
- **Integration:** Daily health notes in Obsidian, log habits in Notion

### [[Content Creation]]
- **Obsidian:** Content ideas, article drafts, creative thinking
- **Notion:** Content calendar, publishing tracker, analytics dashboard
- **Integration:** Write in Obsidian, schedule in Notion

## Maintenance Routines

### Daily
- ✅ Create daily note in Obsidian
- ✅ Check Notion for active tasks
- ✅ Link between systems as needed

### Weekly
- ✅ Review both systems (15 min each)
- ✅ Identify any duplicated information
- ✅ Ensure integration points are working

### Monthly
- ✅ Audit what's in each system
- ✅ Consider moving low-value databases from Notion to Archive
- ✅ Review decision framework - is it still working?

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Keep Using Notion (Done)
✅ Continue using Notion for current workflows
✅ Set up Obsidian Second Brain in parallel
✅ Start capturing new thinking in Obsidian

### Phase 2: Selective Migration (In Progress)
- [ ] Identify 2-3 areas to start in Obsidian
- [ ] Create area notes with links to Notion
- [ ] Start daily notes practice
- [ ] Build habit of note-taking in Obsidian

### Phase 3: Deep Integration (Future)
- [ ] Establish clear workflows between systems
- [ ] Reduce duplicated effort
- [ ] Consider sunsetting low-value Notion databases
- [ ] Fully integrate weekly/monthly review

## Notes

The goal is NOT to replace Notion entirely. Both tools are powerful. The goal is to use each for what it does best:
- **Notion** = Structure, databases, collaboration, tracking
- **Obsidian** = Thinking, connections, knowledge, reflection

Your thinking should flow. Your tracking should be structured. Use both.
