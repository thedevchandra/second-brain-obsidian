Complete Website Buying Checklist and Walkthrough
By Zach Zorn of [MoneyNomad.com](http://moneynomad.com/)

Ownership History and Background

1. Is the website at least 2 years old? Shows some longevity and can give a clear picture of
traffic and income
2. Does the website use a .com or .net url, .com preferably?
3. Does the website use a PBN, or was a PBN used in the past?
4. If yes, be wary of potential longterm negative effects with regards to ranking algorithms
5. If yes, is the PBN included with the sale?
6. If no, your backlink profile and rankings could get hurt if the PBN links are removed
7. If you are using Empire Flippers, they note if a PBN is used/was used
8. Has the website owner or past owners bought backlinks
9. If yes, be wary of potential longterm negative effects with regards to ranking
algorithms. If it was only a few links, I would not be worried
10. Is the current domain name the original domain name?
11. If no, is the owner using a 301 redirect to redirect traffic?
12. If no, is the owner including the old domain with the sale?
13. If no, I would not buy. Too much risk.
14. Is the website owner the original owner?
15. If not, ask the following questions:
16. Did you buy the website or was it given to you?
17. Did you know the person you were buying it from?
18. Did you use a website broker?
19. Why did you buy?
20. What did you do/change/implement since owning it?
21. Ask the seller why they are selling?
22. Is the seller an SEO expert or have experience in buying/flipping website?
23. If yes, I would be considered that low hanging fruit opportunities are gone. Note,
sometimes their email extension will help you figure this out, i.e. [john@seoexperts.com](mailto:john@seoexperts.com). I
would consider this a red flag
24. If you use Empire Flippers, you will be given Google Analytics access by the seller,
look at their email extension when they grant you permission
25. Ask the seller what they would do/change to the website if they kept it?
Website Setup
26. Does the website run on WordPress?
27. I only have WordPress experience, so I would avoid a website that doesn’t if you don’t
have a programming background. WordPress offers ample plugins, themes and support.
28. Does the website use Google Analytics or similar?
29. If no, it will be hard to prove traffic and audience. I wouldn’t purchase.
30. Will the owner give you “read only” Google Analytics access prior to purchase?
31. If no, I would be concerned. You’ll want to verify traffic, acquisitions, audience, etc.

Monetization

1. Is the website monetized in at least 3 different ways? Example: Amazon Associates, Ad
Sense and ShareASale
2. If no, I would be concerned that the main income source could abruptly end
3. For example, what if the website is monetized 90% by AdSense and your account gets
banned/hacked? Another example, while I don’t think that the Amazon Associates
program will end, it’s always a possibility. Each year Amazon decreases the affiliate
commission percentage, meaning I wouldn’t rely heavily on one affiliate. Diversification
is key.
4. If no, could you implement several additional income sources? Example: ads, different
affiliate programs, etc.
5. Does the website make money via Google AdSense?
6. If yes, do you have an approved AdSense account?
7. If no, could you sell dedicated ad space instead of using AdSense?
8. Does the owner have good bookkeeping of income and expenses?
9. If they can not provide screenshots and receipts, I would be concerned
10. Note, if you use Empire Flippers they verified this for you.
11. Does the owner have any relationships with affiliate managers that they will connect you
with?
12. If yes, this is helpful as affiliate managers can make a website even more successful.
Often times, a relationship with an affiliate manager leads to increased commission.
13. Is the owner giving you their affiliate accounts? Sometimes a website owner will hand over to
a buyer their affiliate account so links don’t have to be switched out.
14. If yes, make sure they remove their social security number or tax info prior to giving
you access
15. If yes, make sure you update the payment information with your info
16. If no, you’ll need to get the list of all their affiliate programs and then create new
accounts. Once accounts are set up, you’ll need to switch out their links with your new
tracking links.
17. Sellers typically wont give you their Amazon Associates account, this is normal.
18. Does the owner know, or keep track of, where all their affiliate links are placed?
19. If no, it can be very time consuming for you to find them and to switch them with your
links
20. If you use Empire Flippers, they handle this for you, saving you hours of work
21. Does the website have significant expenses, such as advertising, programming, etc?
22. If yes, ask questions as these expenses might be your responsibility soon.
23. Is the monthly website profit spiking up?
24. If yes, research if the website owner implemented some easy changes to increase
profitably, which leaves you less potential for increasing profitability.
25. If yes, does it appear the owner worked hard to increase profit the last 3 to 6 months
with the intent to sell for a higher price?

Traffic

1. Is the majority of the websites traffic organic search traffic?
2. If no, does it comes from social?
3. If yes, how are they driving traffic? Are their followers engaging? Could this traffic
source dry up in the near future?
4. If no, does it come from advertising (Facebook ads, Google AdWords, etc)?
5. If yes, find out this cost and if it’s increasing or decreasing. I would be very concerned
if this was the main way a website obtained traffic.
6. Is traffic trending down?
7. If yes, research why this is. Are the top articles slowly losing rank because of stale
content, or are competitors creating better content, or is the subject matter no longer
trending? Ahrefs/SEMrush can help with this.
8. If yes, you might have an uphill never ending battle trying to increase the traffic
9. Is traffic trending up?
10. If yes, research if this is a natural trend up or did the owner do something to try and
artificially or temporarily build the traffic up? Ahrefs/SEMrush can help determine this,
along with Google Analytics access.
11. Is traffic staying pretty stable with just subtle ups and down?
12. If yes, this is ideal!
13. Is the website a review website?
14. If yes, are the top income generating articles about trending products that will lose
popularity over time?
15. If yes, know that your profit will decrease as these products phase out, you will
need to create new reviews on hot upcoming products to save your profitability.
16. Does the website traffic come from mainly one country?
17. Neither good or bad, just make sure the answer fits into your strategy.
18. Is the average session duration of visitors AT LEAST 1 to 2 minutes?
19. If no, this means people are not engaged with the website, which means limited
profitability. Can you increase this number with a better user experience or content?
20. Does the website have a significant percentage of returning visitors?
21. Neither good or bad, just make sure the answer fits into your strategy
Included Assets
22. Is the websites’ current domain name, the original domain?
23. If no, is the original domain included in the sale? You want the answer to be yes.
24. Does the website come with a YouTube account, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Skype, Slack,
etc?
25. If yes, make sure to verify ownership and to receive the login information
26. Does the website come with an email list?
27. Find out if the owner is giving you their MailChimp, ConvertKit or MailerLite account
with past email campaigns and statistics, this is ideal.
28. Ask the seller for a list of Skype or email contacts related to the website such as affiliate
managers, manufactures, marketing people, contributors, etc.
29. Ask the seller if they have a “media kit” or any website graphics or art assets that can be
included? All of this will make your life easier in trying to promote the website, and save
you time.
Opportunities For Growth and Increased Profitability
30. Implement an email gathering pop up or opt in. Email lists are very powerful, start one now!
31. Increase user experience by streamlining the website layout and navigation menu. Remove
and adjust banners and content if the pages feel cluttered. The longer you can keep someone
on your website the better, also make your website easy for them to navigate on computer
and mobile!
32. Don’t fill your web pages with advertisements, in fact removing ads and optimizing a few
quality ads can increase your revenue.
33. Sell dedicated ad space. Reach out to the top companies/products that you promote or talk
about, and see if they would be interested in purchasing monthly ad space on your site.
34. Make your side banner ad change depending on the content the viewer is reading. The more
relevant the ad, the better chance of conversion.
35. Make clear call to action buttons. Don’t make the reader look for “buy now” or “download
here” or “learn more” buttons.
36. Ensure affiliate links DO NOT navigate the user to a dead page. If you navigate a user to an
affiliate website where the product doesn’t exist any more, you’ll probably lose the
conversion.
37. Make sure all embedded links open in a new tab and do not navigate the user off your
website. Don’t force the user off your website! There are WordPress plugins to make all links
open in a new tab.
38. Create a “Deals and Coupons” page if you have a review website. If someone is looking for
a coupon, they are close to purchasing, so be the one to convert the sale.
39. Experiment with Google AdWords and/or Facebook ads. Find your top earning article(s) and
try promoting them with keyword targeted ads. You may see a significant spike in profit by
doing this, I did.
40. Update the title and content to articles that used to rank well, but that have dropped off.
Consider adding image alt text.
41. Use a program like Ahrefs/SEMrush to find backlink and other SEO opportunities that can
help boost articles in the search engine results.
42. Can a virtual assistant be hired to decrease the potential work load?
Selling Strategies
43. List your website for sale on Empire Flippers, they are a brokerage so they handle all selling
and migration aspects for a fee.
44. Email other similar websites to see if they would be interested in buying. Use [escrow.com](http://escrow.com/) to
handle private party website transactions.
45. Anchor a banner on your website informing your visitors the website is for sale.
46. Send out an email blast informing your subscribers the website is for sale.
47. List your website for sale on Flippa (I have no experience with this).
48. Get permission, and inform Facebook group members your website is for sale.
