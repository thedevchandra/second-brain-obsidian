### My Heaven

I want to hustle and help other people succeed in their lives and businesses. I want to lead seminars and be an influencer. I want to build a community of inspiring people and change the world.

I give my attention, loyalty, energy to the people who are worth it. I will only show up for those that show up for me. I want amazing people around me to challenge me and motivate me to grow. I want to take on challenges and adventures with my closest friends (Simon, Devin, and Kendra) and communities (Art of Charm). The Tough Mudder in Los Angeles showed me that I can overcome challenges with a great team and have fun doing it. The Hawaii trip allowed me to maintain valuable relationships while exploring an amazing culture.

I want to be an entrepreneur as this will allow me to help the most people. I want to build my “The Process Hacker Business” to help leaders and businesses HACK their operations to increase their revenue, productivity, and impact. With JC’s help from Armor Up Consulting, I want to master coaching, consulting, and training. I’m a leader that thinks about staff welfare and when I build a team, I will find the fun in the mundane part of office life and always takes the hit for my team.

I want to help Devin build up the Productivity Types business and lead seminars. I want to help people figure out the best productivity tools and techniques for their personalities.

I want adventures every year to fulfill my hunger to understand the world. I want to visit many national parks, cities, and countries to continually get out of my comfort zone. Over the next 10 years (length of US passport validity), I want my passport to be packed with stamps from ports of entry and countries all over the world:

I want a partner by my side that is my teammate in life. She is loving, makes me a better person, and supportive of my needs. We are deeply attracted to each other; can talk about anything in-depth; motivate each other to crush it, work out, and eat healthily; and willing to explore and be adventurous.

I want a sister in life that is also loving, makes me a better person, and supportive of my needs. I want to improve my relationship with my sister and help her achieve her dreams.

I want to continue my Naval service to the country as an Engineering Duty Officer. I will lead successful Naval shipbuilding projects and empower my team to do their best work.

I want to raise two beautiful, inside and out, children that are happy and healthy. I want to love them a lot and help them grow. I want them to chase their dreams and strive for growth.

I want to build multiple streams of income with many sources of passive income. I want to own property and invest in multiple businesses:

### My Hell

My mental health and physical health are in danger. I am not happy, angered by small things, and always negative. I keep getting injured and my body will deteriorate faster than I want it too.

I don’t push myself to grow and I feel like I’m just trying to survive. I feel that my career will never amount to anything. I don’t escape the 9-to-5 and I am slaving away hours working for the man.

I don’t waste my energy and time on people who don’t build an intentional relationship with me. I am isolated and have no friends because I am always negative. The friends I do have take advantage of me.

I never have the money to travel or have an adventure. I don’t venture out and explore the world, because my life keeps me in one place. I don’t challenge my conventional wisdom with teachings from other cultures, people, and nationalities.

I am in a toxic relationship with someone who doesn’t care about my needs and always put their needs above mine. I am being taken advantage of and my partner is negative and does not want to strive for continuous growth.
