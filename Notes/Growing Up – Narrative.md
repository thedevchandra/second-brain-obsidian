Primary School

- Nerdy – worked hard at school
- Lacking social awareness – really bad socially, terrible with girls, sensitive
- Indian culture – work hard to achieve career; get parents approval, but was humble
- Religious – became very religious and attended a fundamentalist Hindu temple; I personally got brainwashed to think it’s the right answer
- Stretched way too thin – lots of extracurricular activities, not deliberate
- Happy – decently good friends (sort of still talk to), fun activities (cross country, track), and volunteered a lot

College

- Acceptance into Hopkins – changed my mindset to have a cocky attitude as I would go to a school with similar people and reinvent myself
- First 1-2 Years
    - Career-Oriented attitude
        - Degree – overloaded MechE major with unnecessary extras: CE major, CS minor, Robotics minor 🡪 took my energy so not fully present
        - Extracurriculars – only did those that would pad my engineering degree and resume 🡪 not enjoyable for me, did not help my wellbeing
    - Bad social life – based on partying, loose friendships (surface, not deep), provided no value, acted cocky to turn off a lot of people, and had no hobbies that I was passionate about
- Sophomore Year
    - Found social activities I enjoyed
        - Model UN – international relations, economics interests
        - Rugby – man’s sport however I joined it to be cool (backfired)
- Junior/Senior Year
    - Degree change – dropped everything but MechE; dropped my research
    - Pursed classes that I enjoyed in national security, international relations, and economics (minor)
    - Made better friendships based on depth of relationship

    - Self-help – found Tim Ferriss, Jordan (AoC), Ramit Sethi, and many others

Navy – worked in regulation and engineering

- Materials, NR in DC (5 months) – placed in a position that I was not suited for; worked on a materials manual
    - Social Life – made a bunch of friends (many I would drop due to being bad)
    - Priorities – poor at prioritization and had major FOMO 🡪 low energy
- Training, BRES in Pittsburgh (5 months) – tough lecture style training that was a lot of information; stressful
    - Hit Rock Bottom – barely passing the BRES; negative environment; rocky relationship with roommate
    - Why? – negative environment with attitudes spoiled the experience

AoC – after hitting rock bottom, I invested in coaching

Future – want to do public affairs/ foreign affairs
