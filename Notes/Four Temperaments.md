### Four Termperaments:

- [https://keirsey.com/temperament-overview/](https://keirsey.com/temperament-overview/)
- “Temperament is a configuration of observable personality traits, such as habits of communication, patterns of action, and sets of characteristic attitudes, values, and talents. It also encompasses personal needs, the kinds of contributions that individuals make in the workplace, and the roles they play in society. Each temperament has its own unique qualities and shortcomings, strengths and challenges.”
- Communication - people naturally think and talk about what they are interested in
    - Concrete - talk about the external, concrete world of everyday reality:
    - Abstract - about the internal, abstract world of ideas
- Action - people are trying to accomplish their goals,
    - Cooperative - do the right thing, in keeping with agreed upon social rules, conventions, and codes of conduct
    - Utilitarian - do what gets results, what achieves their objectives as effectively or efficiently as possible
