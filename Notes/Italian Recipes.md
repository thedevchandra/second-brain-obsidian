# Pasta Making

- **Doug 1 water:** 100g of durum flour and 50g of water (each person)
- **Doug 2 eggs:** 100g of durum flour and 1 egg (each person)

## **Cacio e Pepe** (Pasta with Cheese and Black Pepper)

Yield: 6 servings

- 1 pound Pasta (spaghetti, fettuccine, mezze manniche, rigatoni)
- 2 tablespoons salt
- 2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns | or more to taste
- 1½ cups Pecorino Romano | freshly grated, to taste

1. Bring a large pot with 6 quarts of water and 2 tablespoons of salt to a boil. Grind the peppercorns very coarsely, preferably crushing them in a mortar with a pestle or in a spice grinder.
2. Warm up a big bowl for serving the pasta. Use some of the pasta water to heat the bowl, if you like.
3. Cook the spaghetti until al dente. Quickly lift it from the pot with tongs, let it drain for an instant, then drop it into the warm bowl.
4. Immediately scatter a cup of the grated cheese and most of the ground pepper on the pasta, and toss in quickly. As you mix, sprinkle over a spoonful of hot water from the cooking pot to  moisten and amalgamate the pasta and condiments — add more pepper or cheese to taste. Serve right away, while the spaghetti is very hot.

## **Pesto alla Genovese**

Yield: 4 servings

- 2 cups fresh basil leaves, packed (can sub half the basil leaves with baby spinach)
- 1/2 cup freshly grated Romano or Parmesan-Reggiano cheese (about 2 ounces)
- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 1/3 cup pine nuts or almonds (can sub chopped walnuts)
- 3 garlic cloves, minced (about 3 teaspoons)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt, more to taste
- 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, more to taste

1. Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil, and add enough salt to make it as salty as the sea.
2. Meanwhile, place the pesto in a sauté pan, and place over medium heat. Toss to combine, and  add a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.
3. Cook the linguine in the boiling water until almost al dente, and drain, reserving 1 cup of the  pasta's cooking water.
4. Add the pasta to the pesto in the sauté pan and place over medium heat. Cook for 1-2 more  minutes, tossing to combine, and add a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. If needed, add a small amount of the pasta cooking water to thin the pesto.
5. When the pasta is completely with the warmed pesto, place the dish into a warmed serving  dish, and serve.

## **Carbonara**

Yield: 6 servings

- 1 pound pasta, such as rigatoni, fettuccine, or maccheroni
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- ½ pound diced guanciale
- 4 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 cup freshly-grated Pecorino Romano
- Salt & freshly-ground black pepper

1. In a large sauté pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat and add in the diced guanciale. Let the guanciale render its fat until it becomes golden brown and crispy, and then remove from the pan and set aside.
2. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, cheese, and 1 teaspoon of freshly-ground black pepper. Set aside.
3. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and season with salt until as salty as the sea. Add the pasta to the pot, cook until al dente, then transfer the pasta to the large sauté pan set over medium heat. Add in the guanciale, and toss for a minute so that it is evenly incorporated and warmed through.
4. Remove the pan from the heat and add the egg and cheese mixture, tossing gently and thoroughly so that the pasta becomes evenly coated with the sauce. Divide among warmed serving bowls, and serve immediately.

## **Arrabbiata**

Yield: 4 servings

- 1 pound pasta (we chose penne!)
- 1-pound can Italian tomatoes with juices
- ½ cup tomato paste
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 5-6 basil leaves, shredded
- ½ teaspoon crushed red peppers, or more to taste
- 1¼ cups Pecorino Romano, freshly grated
- Sea salt, to taste

1. Heat 4 tablespoons of the extra virgin olive oil in a saucepan, and sauté the garlic over medium-high heat. When the garlic is aromatic, remove from the pan and discard.
2. Add the tomato paste and the crushed red peppers, and reduce the heat to low. Stir until fragrant, about 4 minutes, and stir in the tomatoes.
3. Simmer the sauce over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until it is slightly reduced, about 8 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning of the sauce with salt.
4. In the meantime, bring a large pot of water to a boil, and season until it tastes as salty as the sea.
5. Add the pasta, and cook two minutes less than the package instructions or just before *al dente*.
6. Drain the pasta, reserving the cooking water. Drop the pasta in the sauce, tossing to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce. Allow the pasta to cook in the sauce for 1 to 2 minutes. If needed, add a small amount of the cooking water to the pan to loosen up the pasta.
7. When *al dente*, plate the pasta, and top with the freshly-grated cheese and shredded basil. Serve immediately.

# Tiramisu

- 6 large egg yolks
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 3/4 cup whole milk
- Four 8-ounce containers mascarpone cheese, at room temperature
- 1 1/2 cups espresso or strong coffee, at room temperature
- 1/2 cup brandy or cognac (not mandatory)
- 30 to 32 crisp Italian ladyfingers (savoiardi or Amaretti cookies)
- 1/4 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder
- Bittersweet chocolate, for shaving

1. Line an 8-inch-square baking dish with plastic wrap, leaving a 3-inch overhang on all sides.  Fill a large bowl with ice water.
2. Make the custard: Whisk the egg yolks and sugar in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of  barely simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water) until the sugar dissolves. Slowly  whisk in the milk and cook, whisking constantly, until the custard is light and foamy, about 10  minutes (a thermometer inserted into the mixture should register 170 degrees F).
3. Remove the bowl from the saucepan and set in the bowl of ice water; whisk until the custard  is cool, about 1 minute. Put the mascarpone in a large bowl. Fold the custard into the  mascarpone with a rubber spatula until almost combined, then whisk until just smooth (do  not overmix or the custard will be grainy).
4. Combine the espresso and brandy in a shallow bowl. One at a time, dip the ladyfingers in the  espresso mixture until soaked but not soggy; arrange 2 rows of about 5 biscuits each in the  baking dish. Spread one-third of the mascarpone custard over the ladyfingers. Repeat with a  second layer of espresso-dipped ladyfingers, arranging them in the opposite direction. Top  with another one-third of the custard. Repeat with the remaining ladyfingers, alternating  directions. Spread the remaining custard on top and dust with the cocoa powder. Cover with  plastic wrap; refrigerate at least 4 hours, or overnight.
5. Invert a plate on top of the tiramisu, then flip the tiramisu with the plate. Remove the baking  dish and plastic wrap. Invert a serving plate on top of the tiramisu and flip again so it is cocoa side up. Remove the remaining plastic wrap. Shave curls of chocolate on top with a vegetable peeler.
