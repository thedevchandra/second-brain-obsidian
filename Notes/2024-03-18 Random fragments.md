## Random Revisit Workflow Example

*Note: Opening this note six months after creation to review and connect*

**Original fragments from 2024-03-18:**

Meeting this morning felt productive but can't articulate why. Something about the energy when everyone is building on each other's ideas rather than defending positions.

---

Design systems as languages not templates. Languages have grammar (constraints) but infinite expression. Templates have one expression.

---

The best codebases hide complexity. Not by removing it but by putting it in the right place. Like a good magic trick - the mechanism is complex but the experience is simple.

---

Coffee experiment: lighter roast, higher temp water, longer bloom. Results: brighter acidity, less body. Might be the beans though, not the method.

---

Read somewhere that "expertise is knowing what to ignore." Can't remember where. But it connects to the idea that beginners try to pay attention to everything, experts have developed filters.

---

Why do some conversations generate energy and others drain it? Even when the topic is the same? Something about collaborative vs competitive framing.

**Revisit annotations (added 2024-09-25):**

Looking back at these fragments, several have connected to larger themes:

The "design systems as languages" fragment became part of [[Complex systems cannot be predicted, only guided]]. The language metaphor is exactly about guidance through constraints.

The "hiding complexity" thought connected with [[The elements that matter most are often invisible]] - both are about quality that operates beneath the surface. This also relates to [[2024-03-15 Morning walk thoughts]] and the coffee tasting observation.

"Expertise is knowing what to ignore" - I found the source! It was from [[Thinking, Fast and Slow]]. The idea connects to [[Systems thinking]] and the principle of identifying leverage points rather than trying to control everything. Actually ties back to [[Complex systems cannot be predicted, only guided]] - experts guide rather than control because they know what matters.

The conversation energy question is interesting. I've noticed this pattern more clearly now: conversations generate energy when they're divergent/exploratory (building possibilities) and drain energy when they're convergent/defensive (narrowing to one "right" answer). This might become its own evergreen note: "[[Generative conversations explore possibility space, degenerative conversations defend positions]]"

Coffee experiment was inconclusive but I've gotten better at isolating variables. Single variable changes only. Document in [[Coffee experiments]].

The meeting observation is too vague to do anything with now. If it comes up again with more specificity, worth capturing. For now, letting it fade.

**Connections made:**
- Created [[The elements that matter most are often invisible]]
- Added thoughts to [[Complex systems cannot be predicted, only guided]]
- Noted potential evergreen about conversation energy
- Added coffee data to [[Coffee experiments]]
- Added "expertise" quote to [[Thinking, Fast and Slow]] reference note

**Next revisit:** Will check back in 3 months to see if the conversation energy pattern has developed further.
