# **First, Figure out Where You Want to Live**

One of the lessons that Johnny, AJ, and Jordan learned about living in the Financial District in NYC during the early days of AoC is that while all the trains went there so it wasn’t hard to get to, no one wanted to go there in the evenings or weekends. It was dead.

You need to be in a great part of town, and that’s most easily done by simply doing research in person and online. You can go on scouting trips before you move, you can talk to locals, and you can even look on Yelp. “Do a search on Yelp in the neighborhood you’re thinking about living in,” said AJ, “and if you see a lot of red dots for restaurants and clubs and bars, you’re in a good spot. If everything is twenty to thirty minutes away, realize the obstacle you’re putting up for yourself, not just for hosting people, but for getting away yourself.”

# **Then, Be Open During Every Interaction**

“Everyone entering your life on a social level is an opportunity to grow your network,” noted AJ. It’s true. You never know who can introduce you to whom and as people come into your life, always be open to adding value to their lives and they may do the same to yours.

# **Four Different Groups**

The guys talked about four distinct groups you could enter (or create for yourself) which help you develop different groups of people that make for great cross-pollination.

- **An all men’s group.** This could be a peer group or one focused on entrepreneurship, or even personal development. AJ mentioned that he and Jordan, when they first moved to L.A., were part of a “hookah group” which was just a group of fellow business owners who discussed entrepreneurship issues.
- **A coed group.** The classic example here is a [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) group in various interests you might have. The dynamics are different from the all-male group and this will help vary the types of people you are meeting. You might also consider taking a class — either at a local community college or even something less formal.
- **A show-off group.** This is a group you can invite to a platform in which you can show off your skills. If you’re a coder, invite people to a hackathon. If you’re a musician, like Johnny, you can invite them to shows you play. Maybe you go to open mic nights. Ask people to join you. When we say “show off,” we also mean “showcase.” You’re giving people in your social circle one extra way they can connect with you.
- **A charitable group.** This could be sitting on a board for an organization or simply swinging a hammer at a Habitat for Humanity event. Just as in the other three groups, this group is providing you with a new and diverse set of people with whom you can interact.
