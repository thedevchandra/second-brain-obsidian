Goal: **gradually reduce body fat percentage (PBF)** while maintaining your impressive **84.9 lbs of muscle**

→ S**low, sustainable fat loss phase** that preserves lean mass and keeps you feeling strong.

---

## **🎯 Goal Overview: Slow Fat Loss / Recomposition**

- **Target**: Drop PBF from **19.7% → ~14–15%**
- **Strategy**: Moderate calorie deficit, high-protein intake, strength training + light cardio
- **Pace**: ~0.5–1.0 lb fat loss per week (~250–500 kcal daily deficit)

---

## **🔥 Step 1: Calculate Your Calorie Target**

### **📌 Your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):**

### **1837 kcal**

To estimate your **Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)**, we factor in your activity level.

Assuming you’re **“decently active”** (strength training + moderate movement), your multiplier is around **1.5–1.6**.

> TDEE = BMR × Activity Factor
> 

> TDEE = 1837 × 1.55 ≈ 2857 kcal/day
> 

### **✅ Fat Loss Calorie Target:**

| **Deficit Level** | **Daily Calories** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mild (-250) | **~2600 kcal** | Best for preserving muscle |
| Moderate (-500) | **~2350 kcal** | Faster fat loss, still muscle-friendly |

🔄 **Recommendation**: Start at **2600 kcal/day**, monitor for 2 weeks, then adjust.

---

## **🧮 Step 2: Set Your Macros**

We’ll go with a **high-protein, balanced-carb-fat split** to support fat loss and muscle retention.

### **📊 Macronutrient Targets (at 2600 kcal/day)**

| **Macro** | **Grams** | **Calories** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Protein** | 185–195g | ~740–780 kcal | 1g per lb of body weight; supports muscle |
| **Fats** | 75–85g | ~675–765 kcal | Hormone function, satiety |
| **Carbs** | 260–280g | ~1040–1120 kcal | Fuel training and recovery |

🔁 **Macro Ratio Estimate**:

**~30% Protein | 30% Fat | 40% Carbs**

---

## **🛠️ Pro Tips to Optimize Fat Loss**

- **Training**: Lift 3–5x/week (progressive overload), add 1–2 light cardio sessions
- **Protein timing**: Spread across 3–5 meals to maximize muscle retention
- **Track progress**: Use monthly InBody scans, or track average weight & photos
- **Sleep & stress**: Critical for hormonal balance and fat-burning efficiency
- **Flexible diet**: Use 80/20 rule (80% whole foods, 20% enjoyable choices)
