The disciplined pursuit of less but better. McKeown presents a systematic approach to determining what is absolutely essential and eliminating everything else. Teaches how to discern the vital few from the trivial many, say no gracefully, and make execution effortless by investing in what truly matters. "If it isn't a clear yes, then it's a clear no."
