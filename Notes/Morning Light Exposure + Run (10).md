# Prioritize light exposure each morning

- Outdoor light exposure causes a beneficial cortisol peak early in the morning
- Increases daytime mood, energy and alertness; and helps you fall asleep more easily at night.
- A morning walk outdoors can provide you with both light exposure and optic flow, which quiets activity of the amygdala and related circuits and reduces feelings of stress and anxiety all day.
- Cortisol & cortisol peak
    - Cortisol, a hormone released from the adrenal glands, is the key driver that moves your body from sleep to waking.
    - It is essential for the cortisol pulse to happen early in the day or early in your period of wakefulness.
    - A timer is set when the cortisol pulse occurs, which dictates the release of melatonin about 12–14 hours later.
- Optic flow
    - Optic flow is a phenomenon that occurs when we generate our own forward motion, such as when walking, biking or running.
    - Visual images pass by our eyes, generating a flow of information that has a powerful effect on the nervous system.
    - Optic flow has been shown to reduce the amount of neural activity in the amygdala, which is a brain structure that generates feelings of fear, threat and anxiety.

# How to Optimize Morning Light Exposure

- When: Within 30–60 minutes of waking
- Where: Outside
- How long:
    - ☀️ Sunny day = 5–10 mins
    - 🌤️ Cloudy day = 10–15 mins
    - ☁️ Overcast day = up to 30 mins
- How to do it:
    - Look towards the sunrise or sun, but never stare directly at the sun.
    - Blink as necessary.
    - Wearing contact lenses and prescription glasses are fine, but aim to avoid using sunglasses or hats that are meant to block sunlight from your eyes.
- If you can’t get outside:
    - Bright, blue-hued indoor lights will suffice, but try to get outdoors as soon as you can.
    - Lux is a unit of measure of the intensity of light exposure to the human eye.
        - Cloudy day (some outdoor light) = 10,000 lux
        - Bright indoor light source = no brighter than 1,000 lux
