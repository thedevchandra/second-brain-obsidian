The Situation:

- Had a main client (Ingenu CRO), but didn’t know how long
- Had to buy a $12k Roof
- Ran through my savings due to poor management of finances
    - Spent money on wasteful business programs
    - Spent money on expensive travel experiences
- Was balancing way too much over past two years
    - Rental property with payments and tenants
    - MBA program with 2 classes per week and assignments
    - Navy Reserve with DWEs, ATs, and qualifying EDO
    - Trying to build a profitable business and blog
    - Traveling non-stop to Latam and Europe
- Looing for Stability in San Diego
    - Applied for many jobs in San Diego
    - People were pushing me to accept offers elsewhere

Applied to Booz Allen Hamilton

- Originally planning to move to San Diego
- But I wanted to take some time to travel Europe, attend Nomad Cruise and Nomad Fest
- Seemed like a great company to work for

Why did I want to move to San Diego?

- Have an amazing gut feeling about the place
- Had several great friends and business mentors there
- Great communities for entrepreneurship, outdoors, dance, and fun
- Amazing weather year round and happy people
- Beach neighborhoods are very walkable with stores, gyms, and bars
- Would live in a tiny studio or shared house because location matters more than price
- Airport is in the middle of city with great flight connectivity (Southwest hub)
- Airport bus to LAX (major hub) to have great options to fly international
- Can Uber to Tijuana airport and fly cheap to any destination in Mexico for 3-day weekend
- Make use of Epic pass easily and attend regional Burns
- Can afford to live in San Diego if I work for Booz Allen or another Defense company

Pushed to live in Virginia Beach for several reasons

- Salary was $140, $5k bonus, relocation, and decent vacation
- David Nickum loves Virginia Beach
- Very affordable cost of living and can buy a home
- Great community but I don't’ know anyone
- Be allowed to telework some days and live near a beach
- Be allowed to relocated to the West Coast

Took a Navy Reserve assignment to San Diego

- Hung out with a great coworker, LCDR Joye
- Felt amazing while driving and hanging out with others
- Reconnected with Zach Zorn, John Somnez, Luiz Hererra, Anna, Mika, Terran
- Made new friends such as Mayer
- Found new communities like Volleyball, Tango del Rey, and Travelers group

What was the reality of Virginia Beach:

- For six months, I didn’t know anyone and was bored
- Was not able to formally telework at all, so spent $1700 to live near the beach
- Will probably not be able to relocate West in the near future
- Coworkers don’t want to hang out or can be awkward
- Can’t walk anywhere (3 spots max) and people are cliquey
- Have to drive 30 minutes to work and 20-30 minutes to go anywhere
- Terrible airport connectivity and expensive airfares
- Terrible place to date for a long-term relationship
- **You can’t live the life projected onto you by others, which is actually the life they want for themselves. You can only live the life that you intentionally want decide for yourself.**

Positives:

- Could focus on growing my blog and business to allow me to travel
- Could really take off for Burning Man, Nomad Cruise, and Machu Picchu hike
- Spent a lot of time by myself this year to really think about what I want
- Discovered Latin dance, specifically Bachata and Salsa
- Met Sharon, who is a fellow traveler and probably my closed friend here
- Lived near the beach and enjoyed the sunset on many nights alone
- Got my finances and organization in order so I can get back to travel
