[Burning Man Notes](Burning%20Man%20f01f002fac7a4248bb5bf05d378ec458.md)

We are about 35 DAYS out from The Burn. 

We are so fucking back!

Your leadership council is doing a big push to get everything ready for ya'll. Our camp is going to be so fucking magical this year and we're just really excited to share it with ya'll!

Without further ado, here is the [CAMP GUIDE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mEY4HsVLpmBt-EdOIlXCdwTMpTuo5SrDj7x6hvVJW14/edit?usp=sharing)

It has all the details of who we are, what our camp provides, and what is expected of ya'll. 99% of the questions we get asked are answered in the camp guide. So, just read it ya'll. 

Also, we made you this Splash Page [[https://shorturl.at/ISVoY](https://shorturl.at/ISVoY)] with literally all the links to all the things in one place. Save it, Bookmark it, etc. It'll also live in the WhatsApp Channel Description. We will be regularly updating the splash page as new docs come online. 

Our Camp [Shift Sign Up Board](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17cl9J4BBV4Ys5c-KoBvHx_6lRIPptgJaYn-MXEKGyqY/edit?gid=0#gid=0) is also now live. This is where you sign up for cleaning, meals, and bodega shifts. Notice the "Party" tab on the bottom of the page to sign up for Camp Party shifts. Our camp only functions because of folks like you signing up to do these things.  This board will be printed out and posted at camp. 

First Time Campers. AJ is doing his absolute best to reach out to all ya'll. If you haven't heard from AJ, reach out to him directly on WhatsApp (585-429-0725). AJ is here for any questions or concerns you may have. 

There are still lots of folks who haven't filled out [THE FOOTPRINT FORM](https://forms.gle/yvpFnZztM6Kt79JL7). Our camp layout is a bit like a puzzle. We need to fit all your tents, yurts, and RVs with all our existing camp infrastructure. It's a big job, and one that Joel crushes for us. However, we need to know what you're bringing, how your getting to our camp, what kind of vehicle you're bringing. THIS IS ALL SUPER IMPORTANT. We understand that you maybe needed some time to figure this out, but it's crunch time baby! Get your shit sorted and let us know. 

Some folks still haven't PAID DUES. Again, we're getting to crunch time when we need that money to buy critical stuff for our camp. If you need a payment plan, reach out to Noah. We can do incremental payments if that works for ya. Just gotta make it happen, tbh. Get on it.

We love you all dearly and are SO excited to do this thing together!
If you have questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out!
