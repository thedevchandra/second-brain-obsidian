Money Nomad, along with a majority of my other websites, all run on the Jannah theme, using
the “Main” template.

The theme can be bought and downloaded here: [https://themeforest.net/item/jannah-wordpress-news-magazine-theme/19659555](https://themeforest.net/item/jannah-wordpress-news-magazine-theme/19659555)

You can preview the theme and different templates here: [https://preview.themeforest.net/item/jannah-wordpress-news-magazine-theme/full_screen_preview/19659555?_ga=2.192737321.2054083273.1663279770-800242393.1569610750](https://preview.themeforest.net/item/jannah-wordpress-news-magazine-theme/full_screen_preview/19659555?_ga=2.192737321.2054083273.1663279770-800242393.1569610750)

Notes:
The theme will need to be downloaded from the Envato Marketplace, and then uploaded to your
website, all of which can be done within WordPress.
Here is an article that walks you through installing a downloaded theme: [https://wordpress.com/](https://wordpress.com/)

You can switch your current theme to Jannah, but I’d recommend setting up a duplicate site to
ensure all of your content gets transitioned over correctly before making changes to your live
site. Money Nomad used to run on a different theme, I then switched to Jannah and all of my
content automatically reformed into the Jannah theme with no issue.
