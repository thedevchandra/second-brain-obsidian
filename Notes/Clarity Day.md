How to Take a Clarity Day by Mike Vardy of Productivityist

What is a Clarity Day?

A Clarity Day is a day to revisit where you’ve been over the last several months and then begin to map out what you want to do from that day forward.

The best way to move forward is with purpose and – fittingly – clarity. Taking a Clarity Day will give you a better chance to achieving that.

Setting Yourself Up for a Clarity Day

If you want to take a Clarity Day, here are some things to keep in mind:

1. Schedule it well in advance. I like using my birthday because it is a milestone day and I’m generally not expected to work that day. I also use Groundhog Day to do this at it falls right at the midway point of my year. That means I’m getting at least two Clarity Days every 12 months and they line up perfectly with how I structure my calendar year.
2. Block off all outside appointments. Make sure you are not available to be booked for anything on that day at all. That’s doesn’t mean you can’t initiate having a lunch with someone or an early morning coffee, but don’t give that power to anyone else but you.
3. Ensure the tasks you have lined up for that day are aligned with what a Clarity Day is meant for. Essentially, this will be anything that can act as a distraction and keep you from focusing on the mission of the day...which is clarity. (Actually, making your Clarity Day a “no tech day” or a
“Disconnected Day” is a good idea.)
4. Book (or find) a place where your ability to have clear focus isn’t going to be a challenge. That may mean booking a small meeting space for the day or asking your partner to take the kids out. It may even mean taking a day off when people won’t be home so you’re free to roam and make the most of the time and space you’ll have.

Once you’ve set everything up for your Clarity Day, when the day arrives you’ll need to make sure you have your tasks lined up to knock them out as the hours pass by. Essentially, a Clarity Day is one big time chunk. So use your time as wisely as possible because you will rarely get a time chunk all to yourself that is this long.
