# What is a Compound Lift?

A compound lift is an exercise that works multiple muscle groups and joints at the same time, as opposed to isolation exercises that target just one muscle or joint (like a bicep curl). These movements are the heavy hitters of strength training because they mimic natural, functional human motions—think lifting, pushing, or pulling—and deliver maximum bang for your buck in terms of strength, muscle growth, and efficiency.

Key Features:

- Multi-Joint Movement: Involves two or more joints (e.g., knees and hips in a squat, or shoulders and elbows in a bench press).
- Multiple Muscle Groups: Recruits big muscles (like quads or lats) and smaller stabilizers (like core or traps) simultaneously.
- Systemic Impact: Because they demand so much effort, they trigger a bigger hormonal response (testosterone, growth hormone), which supports overall muscle growth and strength (backed by studies like those in the Journal of Applied Physiology).

**Deadlift**

- **Why it’s top:** Hits the entire posterior chain—hamstrings, glutes, lower back, traps, and core—plus forearms and grip strength. Studies (like those in the *Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research*) show it produces some of the highest hormonal responses (testosterone, growth hormone) due to the sheer muscle mass involved.
- **Effectiveness:** Unmatched for total-body strength and real-world lifting capacity.

- **Why it’s great:** King of lower-body lifts. Targets quads, glutes, hamstrings, and core, with secondary work for the upper back under load. Research (e.g., Schoenfeld, 2016) highlights its role in lower-body hypertrophy and strength.
- **Effectiveness:** Slightly edges out bench for lower-body focus and core stability, though it’s neck-and-neck with deadlifts.

1. **Bench Press (Barbell)**
    - **Why it’s key:** Best upper-body push movement. Hits chest, shoulders, and triceps hard. Electromyography (EMG) studies (e.g., *JSCR*, 2012) consistently rank it tops for pec activation.
    - **Effectiveness:** Essential for upper-body strength and mass, though less "full-body" than squat or deadlift.

- **Why it’s strong:** Builds shoulders, triceps, and core (for stabilization). It’s a pure test of upper-body pressing power. Research shows it activates deltoids more than bench (Saeterbakken, 2011).
- **Effectiveness:** Slightly less muscle mass involved than bench, but unbeatable for shoulder development and standing strength.

1. **Pull-Up/Chin-Up (Weighted if possible)**
    - **Why it’s clutch:** Best bodyweight compound lift. Targets lats, biceps, traps, and core. Studies (e.g., Youdas, 2010) confirm high lat activation, especially with chin-ups.
    - **Effectiveness:** Lacks lower-body work, but phenomenal for upper-body pulling strength and back size.
2. **Bent-Over Row (Barbell)**
    - **Why it’s solid:** Hits lats, traps, rhomboids, biceps, and even some posterior chain. EMG data (Fenwick, 2009) shows it’s a top mover for mid-back thickness.
    - **Effectiveness:** Great pulling complement to pressing lifts, though it’s less systemic than deadlifts or squats.
