Use breathing to increase energy

- Cyclic hyperventilation shifts the autonomic nervous system towards feelings of increased alertness and enhanced focus.
- This pattern of breathing consists of rapid inhales and exhales, which causes hyperventilation, releasing adrenaline and thus increasing neural excitability.
- To practice
    - Take a deep inhale through your nose, immediately followed by a deep exhale (active or passive) through your mouth.
    - Repeat the above 20–25x, then fully exhale until lungs are empty.
    - Hold for 15–30 seconds.
    - Repeat for up to 5 minutes total.
- Expect to feel a little tingly or agitated during the exercise. However, over the next few minutes, adrenaline levels will increase to greatly improve your focus and attention.
