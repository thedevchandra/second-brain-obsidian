# Vocabulary

- Dry Dock Basin - floor of the dry dock
- Caisson
    - Ballasting system - used to regulate buoyancy in the caisson
    - Superflood system - used to pump water into the dry dock above the sea level
- Pumpwell
    - Flooding system - helps flood the dry dock
    - Dewatering pumps - pumps used during docking or undocking evolution
    - Drainage pumps - pumps are on all the time from natural water build-up from rainfall or higher tides
- Dock Service Connections
    - Shore power - powers the shipboard systems while the ship is in dry dock
    - Auxillary Seawater (ASW)
    - Freshwater (FW)
- Emergency Diesel Generator - a portable unit that is placed top-side on the vessel
- Draft Markers - indicates how high the ship sits in the water
- Lines - used to handle the ship
- Wires - make fine adjustments to the boat by the inch
- Sights - surveying equipment
- Markets - bright orange pieces of tape
- Rulers - measuring tape
- Stern Reference Point - block that all the other blocks are built off of

# Roles

- Docking Officer (Code 340 at Puget)
    - Shipyard Docking Officer (SDO) - an EDO that is qualified DO for a shipyard to oversee docking evolutions
    - Assigned Docking Officer (ADO) or Docking Coordinator - conducts the specific docking evolution with the paperwork and details; has delegated authority from the shipyard commander
    - Qualifying Docking Officer (QDO) - in qualification so needs release authority from a DO
- Dockmaster (Code 340) - one senior civilian supervisor that supervises the SDO and oversees docking evolutions
- Dry Dock Foreman (Pier Master) - the lead tradesperson for a specific dry dock, including mechanical and electrical
- Docking Observer - government representative for observing the contractor
- Shop 64 (Shipwrights) - sets up the blocks; operates the lines and sights
- Shop 99 (Temp Services) - sets up power ASAP with battery and diesel backups and water for decay heat removal; operates the lines and sights
- Pilot - a harbor pilot that helps guide the ship from the pier to before the drydock that can speak to the tugs
- Project Team (Code 300) - conducting the availability, including the Project Superintendent, DPS, APS, PEPM, BSO, etc.
- Ships Force
    - CO - has authority until the ship crosses the sill

# Timeline

- A-4
    - Prefabrication - have everything ready (blocks) that is being staged
- A-3
    - Build - start putting items in the dock
        - Verify that the blocks are precisely in position per the NAVSEA Blocking diagrams
- A-1
    - Shipyard docking conference - internal shipyard meeting to make sure the shipyard is ready to receive the ship; do a notional schedule of events with the highlights and tide window
    - Ship’s force docking conference with the pilot - the docking officers, the dockmaster, and the dry dock foreman brief what will occur during the drydocking evolution
        - Tell them that the ship will have X draft and limited to X degrees of list, and trim can be X
- A-1 day
    - Docking conference - Everyone together in one room to understand what is happening during the dry docking
        - Communications - different channels
        - Review Draft Calculations - ensure the vessel clears blocks written in the Naval Ships' Technical Manual (NSTM) based on the lowest project displacement and the tide chart and winds
    - Docking Officer will ensure that the draft, list, and trim are in line
- A - drydocking
    - Ship Movement
        - Use the tugs and log broncs to move it close, but lines are used to move the ship in the dry dock
        - 10 lines per side
        - 1 haul-in line
    - Install the Caisson
        - Need to have power in the caisson to dewater the caisson
        - Flood the caisson down into place and leave it flooded
        - Use lines to hold the caisson in the inner face of the sill
        - Changes in the tide will put forces on caisson
    - Positioning Ship During Pumpdown
        - Dewatering pumps will remove water from the dry dock
        - All the lines on the side of the line are fine-tunned
        - Verify landing parameters
        - If not, reflood and may need multiple landings
    - Pump down to remove water
        - At certain levels, add temp services
        - Pauses for break
    - Inspect the drydock
        - The drydocking team looks at the blocks to ensure complete contact for all the blocks with NAVSEA Blocking Diagram
