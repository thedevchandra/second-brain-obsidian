Went for an early morning walk before the city woke up. The light at that hour has a quality that makes everything feel suspended.

Started thinking about [[Systems thinking]] and how it applies to personal habits. When I try to force a behavior change directly, it rarely sticks. But when I adjust the environment or the trigger, the change happens naturally. This connects to what I read in [[Atomic Habits]].

The conversation with [[Sarah Chen]] yesterday keeps coming back. She mentioned how her team at [[TechCorp]] uses [[Emergence|emergent planning]] rather than rigid roadmaps. They set constraints and principles, then let solutions emerge from the team. Reminds me of [[Out of Control]] and the idea that [[Complex systems cannot be predicted, only guided]].

Coffee shop stop: tried the new Ethiopian blend at [[Blue Bottle Coffee]]. Notes of blueberry and jasmine. Made me think about [[The elements that matter most are often invisible]] - the roasting process, the origin soil, the picker's skill - all hidden in that one sip.

Need to write more about the connection between [[Emergence]] and [[Design systems]]. There's something there about creating frameworks that allow for creativity rather than constraining it. The best design systems feel like they have room to breathe.

Also want to revisit [[Evergreen notes turn ideas into objects that you can manipulate]]. The act of writing these thoughts down is already helping me see new connections I missed during the walk.
