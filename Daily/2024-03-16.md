## Notes

Following up on [[2024-03-15]] thoughts about emergent systems and information architecture.

Implemented the first prototype based on yesterday's meeting notes ([[2024-03-15 1430]]). The fractal approach is already showing promise - instead of deep nested menus, users can start anywhere and discover paths through contextual links.

## Reading

Revisited [[68 Bits of Unsolicited Advice]] from [[Kevin Kelly]]. Point #23 about productivity really landed today: "Productivity is often a distraction. Don't aim for better ways to get through your tasks as quickly as possible, rather aim for better tasks that you never want to stop doing."

This applies directly to how we're rethinking the product. Instead of optimizing for speed, optimize for engagement and discovery.

## Projects

Connected with the team about [[Product usage analysis]]. The data supports the hypothesis from [[2024-03-15]] - users who discover features through contextual links have 3x higher retention than those who find them through navigation menus.

This validates the fractal journaling philosophy: capture thoughts in context, let connections reveal themselves over time.

## Entertainment

Played [[Catan]] with friends tonight. Interesting how the game mechanics create emergent strategy - no two games are ever the same even with the same players. The trade negotiation system is essentially a network of dynamic relationships.

Similar principle to [[The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild]] - give players tools and let them discover their own solutions rather than prescribing a single path.

## Reflection

The pattern I'm noticing across work, reading, and play: systems that allow emergence are more engaging than systems that enforce structure. Whether it's note-taking in [[Obsidian]], game design, or product architecture.

This connects back to [[2023-09-12 Meeting with Steph]] where we discussed emergence. The ideas from [[Out of Control]] keep proving relevant across different domains.

Tomorrow: Draft the full proposal incorporating these insights. Reference [[2024-03-15]] and [[2024-03-15 1430]] for specific examples.
