## Notes

Morning reflection on [[Evergreen notes turn ideas into objects that you can manipulate]]. The idea of turning thoughts into manipulable objects resonates with how I've been organizing my work lately.

Had coffee and listened to [[Bass on Top]] while reviewing project plans. The [[Jazz]] album's approach to improvisation reminds me of how creative problem-solving works in product design.

## Meetings

Met with the design team to discuss the new feature. Referenced [[Steph Ango]]'s philosophy on [[Obsidian]] workflows. The fractal approach to organizing information could help us structure the user experience better.

## Ideas

The concept from [[Kevin Kelly]]'s work about emergent systems applies well to our current challenge. When individual components interact freely, unexpected solutions emerge naturally rather than being forced.

Started reading more about this in [[Out of Control]].

## Tasks

- [x] Review product roadmap
- [x] Team meeting on UX patterns
- [ ] Draft proposal for new information architecture
- [ ] Follow up on [[2023-09-12 Meeting with Steph]] action items

## Random thoughts

Thinking about how [[Blade Runner]] and [[Futurama]] both explore themes of identity and consciousness, but from completely different angles. One is noir [[Sci-fi]], the other is comedy. Both are profound in their own way.

Maybe worth exploring more in [[Movies]] and [[Shows]] categories.
