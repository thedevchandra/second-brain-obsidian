Quick capture during design meeting (see [[2024-03-15]]):

Sarah made an excellent point about fractal information architecture. Instead of forcing users into a rigid hierarchy, we should let connections emerge naturally based on how they actually use the system.

This connects to several ideas:
- [[Evergreen notes turn ideas into objects that you can manipulate]]
- The [[Obsidian]] philosophy of linking over categorization
- [[Steph Ango]]'s approach to bottom-up organization

The key insight: users don't think in hierarchies. They think in associations, contexts, and relationships. Our navigation should reflect this reality.

Action items:
- Map out the current forced hierarchy
- Identify natural connection patterns from user research
- Prototype a link-based navigation system
- Test with 5-10 power users

This might also tie into the [[2023 Japan Trip]] observation about how [[Fushimi Inari]] paths work - multiple routes to the same destination, choose your own journey, discover connections along the way.

The best systems are discoverable, not prescriptive.
