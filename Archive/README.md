# Archive

This folder is the **fourth category in the PARA system** (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive). It contains inactive items from the other three categories that are no longer actively useful but worth keeping for reference.

## Purpose

The Archive serves as a "time capsule" for:
- **Completed projects** that are finished and closed
- **Inactive areas** you're no longer responsible for
- **Outdated resources** that are no longer relevant
- **Historical records** of past work and decisions
- **Legacy notes** from before you started using this system

## When to Archive

Archive items when they meet these criteria:

1. **Projects:** When a project is complete or cancelled
2. **Areas:** When you're no longer responsible for an area
3. **Resources:** When information becomes outdated or no longer useful
4. **System files:** Old reports, deprecated templates, legacy documentation

## Using the Archive

### Archiving Items

When archiving, you can either:
- Move items directly into the Archive folder (flat structure)
- Create dated subfolders (e.g., `Archive/2026-01-13/`) to preserve context
- Maintain the original folder structure if needed

### Retrieving from Archive

Don't worry about perfect organization here. You can always:
- Use Obsidian's Quick Switcher (Cmd/Ctrl+O) to search
- Use global search to find archived content
- Pull items back out of Archive if they become active again

## Archive Strategy

**The "Clean Slate" approach (recommended for new users):**
1. Move all existing notes to `Archive/[today's date]/`
2. Start fresh with your new system
3. Pull out archived notes only when needed

**The "As You Go" approach:**
1. Archive items naturally as they become inactive
2. Review and archive during monthly reviews
3. Keep Archive lean and organized

**Remember:** The Archive is not a graveyard—it's a library. Items here are still searchable and accessible, just not cluttering your active workspace.
