# Content Creation

An ongoing area focused on creating and publishing valuable content across multiple platforms.

## Standard

Publish 1-2 high-quality pieces per week that provide genuine value and demonstrate clear thinking.

## Notion Integration

**Content Calendar**: [View in Notion](https://www.notion.so/your-content-calendar-id)
**Analytics Dashboard**: [View in Notion](https://www.notion.so/your-analytics-id)

I use Notion to track:
- Publishing schedule and deadlines
- Content status (draft → review → published)
- Performance metrics and analytics
- Topic brainstorming board

I use Obsidian for:
- Deep research and synthesis
- Connecting ideas across domains
- Drafting and refining arguments
- Building evergreen knowledge base

## Current Projects

- [[Newsletter Redesign]] - Refreshing format and structure (Q1 2026)
- [[Video Content Series]] - Launching YouTube channel (Q1-Q2 2026)

## Content Ideas & Research

Ideas develop here in Obsidian, connecting to existing knowledge:

- [[The Power of Small Bets in Content Creation]]
- [[Why Most Content Strategies Fail]]
- [[Building in Public vs Building in Private]]
- [[Content as a Learning Tool]]

## Workflows

### Daily Content Workflow
1. **Morning** (Obsidian): Review daily note, capture new ideas
2. **Focus Block** (Obsidian): Write/research for 90 minutes
3. **Afternoon** (Notion): Update content calendar, check deadlines
4. **Evening** (Obsidian): Capture learnings in daily note

### Weekly Review
1. Review published content performance in Notion
2. Update content calendar in Notion for upcoming week
3. Create Obsidian note: `YYYY-MM-DD Weekly Content Review`
4. Capture insights and patterns, link to relevant evergreen notes
5. Identify 2-3 topics for next week based on research depth in Obsidian

### Monthly Review
1. Export analytics from Notion
2. Create comprehensive review note in Obsidian
3. Identify successful patterns and themes
4. Update content strategy based on insights
5. Archive completed projects

## Review Questions

- What's working well in my content process?
- Which topics are resonating most with my audience?
- Am I maintaining my publishing standard?
- What's the balance between planning (Notion) and creating (Obsidian)?
- Are there patterns in my most successful content?
- What should I start/stop/continue?

## Recent Insights

*Capture key insights as they emerge:*

- **2026-01-13**: Realized my best content comes from connections between existing notes, not starting from scratch. Need to spend more time in Obsidian graph view.
- **2026-01-10**: Notion calendar helps with consistency, but Obsidian helps with quality. Both are necessary.
- **2026-01-05**: Publishing schedule anxiety was killing creativity. Shifted to "create value" mindset instead of "hit deadlines."

## Goals for 2026

- [ ] Build content buffer (4 weeks ahead)
- [ ] Develop 5 cornerstone evergreen pieces
- [ ] Create repeatable research → draft → publish workflow
- [ ] Launch video content series
