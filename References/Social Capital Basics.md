# Authentic engagement > superficial networking

At a networking event, it is more beneficial to form real connections rather than merely collecting business cards, as this lays the groundwork for meaningful collaborations and friendships. Genuine interactions increase the likelihood of sustained engagement and recognition.

It is important to have curiosity in everyday interactions. Listening actively and seeking to add value to others' lives, even through small gestures like making useful connections via social media, enhances one's impact.

Avoid transactional relationships where interactions are based on expected returns. Instead, fostering a culture of generosity without immediate expectations can create an environment where opportunities naturally arise and flourish.

The concept of "priming" is introduced as a way to subtly position oneself to add value by addressing others' needs. This involves understanding and catering to specific requirements in a thoughtful manner, which can lead to mutually beneficial outcomes.

"Social capital" is defined as the value created by sharing resources like knowledge and connections to assist others. This should be done in a non-transactional manner, genuinely contributing to others' success without waiting for something in return.

Do not network excessively or maintain relationships with "takers" who do not reciprocate in the ecosystem of giving. Authentic networking is more about being oneself and interacting naturally rather than scheduling reminders or orchestrating every interaction.

Lastly, it touches on opportunistic networking, where understanding and responding to others' needs can lead to successful engagements, as seen in examples of hosting events or gatherings that align with the interests of others.

How can you keep your social capital balance healthy (and growing)?

- Renew and refresh your network by connecting people constantly
- Remember to be curious and to be open — not just about people but about life
- Practice empathy to expand your bandwidth and depth in connecting with others.
