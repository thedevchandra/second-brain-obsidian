Prioritize light exposure each morning

- Outdoor light exposure causes a beneficial cortisol peak early in the morning
- Increases daytime mood, energy and alertness; and helps you fall asleep more easily at night.
- A morning walk outdoors can provide you with both light exposure and optic flow, which quiets activity of the amygdala and related circuits and reduces feelings of stress and anxiety all day.
