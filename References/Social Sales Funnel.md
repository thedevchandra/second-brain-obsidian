You’ve heard about social sales funnels before so let’s do a brief review. To start let’s take a look at a traditional sales funnel:

# Top of the funnel....

Social Sales Funnels operate and are used in a very similar way. Your “hot leads” will be the phone numbers you collect when out socializing and through online dating.

Leads come from places like...

- Bars
- Clubs
- Social clubs
    - crossfit
    - yoga
    - running group
    - co-ed sports
    - meetup groups
    - bar crawls
- Regular music events
- Day game

When you get these leads, invite them to the bottom of the funnel -- the regular event or activity you host or lead.

Different types of leads:

- Romantic -- women you are interested in being more than friends
- Platonic -- women or men who you would like to add to your social network.

When collecting leads, adopt the social ambassador mindset. How can you provide value into the romantic and platonic leads you get? Typically, it’s by showing them a good time!

There are a couple of ways to gather leads -- phone numbers vs. Facebook.

Here’s a simple mindset to have in mind to help decide which way to gather leads.

A quality interaction will lead to a quality number. For weak connections or interactions use Facebook so she can build a connection with you through your Facebook page.

# Middle of the funnel...

The rules here are pretty straight forward:

- For the girls you are interested in the most, grab some happy hour with her before the event.
- If the event is a week or two out to keep the connection going. Be sure to extend an invitation to her and her friends so that everyone can have a good time. Also, she’ll feel more comfortable showing up with some girlfriends.
- Otherwise text with some banter periodically to hold interest.

# Bottom of the funnel...

The bottom of the funnel is the regular event you host, participate in or lead the charge on. Some ideas for the bottom of the funnel:

- Sunday or Saturday pool parties
- Sunday or Saturday beach sessions
- Sunday or Saturday park meetups
- Hiking groups
- Running group
- Pub crawl group
- Going to a dance club regularly
- House party
- BBQ party
- Sunday brunches
- Regular music events
- Co-ed sports
