# Comprehensive Blood Analysis (89 Biomarkers)

**Complete blood count (CBC) + differential ($35):** [https://www.questhealth.com/product/complete-blood-count-cbc-6399M.html](https://www.questhealth.com/product/complete-blood-count-cbc-6399M.html)

- Measure the essential components of the blood. Healthcare professionals may use this test to help assess for anemia, blood disorders, inflammation, infection, and more.
- A CBC is the measure of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in the blood. White blood cells defend the body against disease, red blood cells deliver oxygen to the body, and platelets help the body to form a clot to stop bleeding. Information from the CBC is commonly used to diagnose nutritional deficiencies, anemia, infection, and chronic disease.
- Red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, MCHC, platelets, MPV, RDW, absolute and relative neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils

Measure the essential components of the blood. Healthcare professionals may use this test to help assess for anemia, blood disorders, inflammation, infection, and more.

- If you are ordering your own blood test you may need to add MPV separately. - Quest has it

**Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) ($55):** [https://www.questhealth.com/product/comprehensive-metabolic-panel-cmp-10231M.html](https://www.questhealth.com/product/comprehensive-metabolic-panel-cmp-10231M.html)

- The CMP test measures 14 components of the blood to assess liver and kidney function, hypertension, proteins, blood sugar, and calcium.
- A comprehensive metabolic panel is a combination of tests used to evaluate your organ function and check for conditions such as diabetes, liver disease, and kidney disease. The components of this test include:
    - Glucose - Glucose is a type of sugar that is obtained or made from the food we eat, and it circulates in the blood to provide your body’s cells with energy. Consistently high blood glucose levels lead to diabetes and cause damage to the inner lining of blood vessels increasing the risk for cardiovascular disease.
    - Kidney function - The kidneys help to maintain your blood pressure and body pH, as well as filter the blood to absorb nutrients and get rid of waste products. The kidney markers determine the effectiveness of these functions, as well as indicate if you are drinking enough water.
    - Electrolytes - The cells in your body are like little batteries in that they produce energy and need a proper charge. Electrolytes help to balance the charge of each cell which influences the body’s pH. Electrolyte balance is needed for muscle contractions including the heart, nerve impulses to send messages around the body, and to maintain fluid balance.
    - Liver function - The main function of the liver is to filter the blood coming from your digestive system before it passes to the rest of the body. The liver is responsible for breaking down chemicals and drugs so that they can be eliminated by the body. The liver also produces proteins that transport hormones and nutrients around in the blood. Liver enzymes help to monitor liver function and inflammation that comes from medications, infections, and excess body fat.
- Fasting glucose, **uric acid**, BUN, creatinine, eGFR, sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide (bicarbonate), calcium, **phosphorus (phosphate)**, total protein, albumin, globulin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, **LDH**, AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), **GGT**
- If you are ordering your own blood test you may need to add GGT, uric acid, phosphorus and LDH separately.

**Hemoglobin A1c and Insulin ($45):** [https://www.questhealth.com/product/hemoglobin-a1c-test-496M.html](https://www.questhealth.com/product/hemoglobin-a1c-test-496M.html)

- Detect abnormal blood sugar levels. Healthcare providers use this test to help determine whether you're at risk for prediabetes or diabetes.
- Glucose measures your blood sugar level at that exact moment in time, whereas hemoglobin A1c is a measurement of your average blood sugar over the last two months. This marker in combination with fasting glucose and triglyceride levels is an effective way to monitor how well your body controls blood sugar and if your diet is too high in sugar and carbohydrates. Consistently high blood sugar levels increase your risk of insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

**Iron assessment ($65):** [https://www.questhealth.com/product/iron-tibc-ferritin-panel-5616M.html](https://www.questhealth.com/product/iron-tibc-ferritin-panel-5616M.html)

- Iron is an essential mineral needed to form red blood cells which carry oxygen around the body and deliver it to tissues. This group of tests measures how much iron your body has stored to make new red blood cells. However, too much iron is toxic to the body and can lead to organ and joint damage. These tests assure that your levels are just right.
- Ferritin, serum iron, TIBC

**Lipid panel ($65):** [https://www.questhealth.com/product/cholesterol-lipid-panel-94355M.html](https://www.questhealth.com/product/cholesterol-lipid-panel-94355M.html)

- Measure lipid levels to help assess risk for heart attack, heart disease, and other diseases of the blood vessels.
- The cardiovascular system is made up of your heart and blood vessels and is responsible for transporting oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and waste products throughout the body. Most of the cholesterol used by the body is produced by the liver. Cholesterol is the structural component of cells providing a protective barrier, it is used to manufacture hormones, and it helps the liver create bile for digesting dietary fats. At certain ratios, in combination with other risk factors, elevated lipids can increase your risk for heart disease and stroke.
- Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, **VLDL**, triglycerides

**Cardiovascular risk and inflammation markers**

- **Cardiovascular risk markers:** LDL particle number (LDL-p) and Apolipoprotein B are additional markers that more adequately correlate to cardiovascular risk than even LDL cholesterol. Studies suggest that people with high LDL cholesterol but low LDL particle number are not at increased risk of heart disease.
- **Inflammation markers:** Inflammation is your body’s reaction to stress or injury. While this response to stress and injury is important and even life-saving in the short-term, long-term inflammation contributes to many chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, dementia, osteoporosis, cancer, and diabetes. This collection of inflammation markers gives an adequate assessment of total body inflammation.
- Apolipoprotein B, homocysteine, high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-CRP)

**Thyroid panel ($55):** [https://www.questhealth.com/product/thyroid-tsh-function-test-36127M.html](https://www.questhealth.com/product/thyroid-tsh-function-test-36127M.html)

- The thyroid gland is the engine of your body. It controls how your body uses energy, which is also called your metabolism. Low thyroid function can lead to symptoms of fatigue, weight gain, hair loss, and cold intolerance while an overactive thyroid can cause hyperactivity, irritability, weight loss, and heat intolerance. There are many places in the cascade of thyroid hormone production that can malfunction.
- There is a large percentage of people who walk around with suboptimal thyroid function, but normal-appearing TSH. For this reason, it is important to get an accurate assessment of thyroid function (TSH and free T4), as well as a measurement of your conversion to the active hormones (free T3).
- TSH, free T4, free T3, reverse T3, thyroid peroxidase antibodies and antithyroglobulin antibodies

**Vitamins & Minerals**

- **Magnesium:** Magnesium is a cofactor in more than 300 enzyme systems that regulate diverse biochemical reactions in the body including protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, and blood pressure regulation. Magnesium is commonly deficient in modern diets. RBC magnesium is known to be a more accurate marker of your intracellular stores of magnesium than serum magnesium.
- **Vitamin D ($78):** [https://www.questhealth.com/product/vitamin-d-test-17306M.html](https://www.questhealth.com/product/vitamin-d-test-17306M.html)
    - Measure the levels of Vitamin D in your blood, which is a key nutrient that helps your body absorb calcium and phosphorus. Both are essential for building healthy and strong bones.
    - Vitamin D has an important role in calcium absorption, as well as a crucial role in influencing your immune system and your risk for chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer. The primary source of Vitamin D is sunlight exposure to sunscreen-free bare skin.
- Magnesium RBC, vitamin D (vitamin D, 25-hydroxy), B12 and folate

**Cortisol, total**

**Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1)**

**REPRODUCTIVE HORMONES (Optional) ($75):** [https://www.questhealth.com/product/testosterone-test-mens-873M.html](https://www.questhealth.com/product/testosterone-test-mens-873M.html)

- Male
    - This blood test helps you check testosterone levels for potential imbalances - including hypogonadism (i.e. low testosterone). Testosterone may affect sex drive, fertility, energy, muscle mass, and bone density.
    - Total testosterone, free testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)
- Female - If you would like to do hormone testing, please contact me (support@dralexisshields.com) before ordering hormone tests. Your health goals will determine what tests we will order and when the test should be performed.

## **Tips to get the most accurate blood test**

For blood testing best practices, follow these 9 tips to get the most accurate test:

1 - Stick to your normal routine the day before your test.

2 - Do not get your test done on a day that you feel ill unless the test is to determine why you have that specific illness.

3 - Eat a diet that is normal to you prior to your test. Do not get your testing done after a big change in your diet, such as after a big party, during the holidays, or after vacation.

4 - Make sure to follow your fasting recommendations. If your test needs to be done while fasting, schedule it for as close to 8-12 hours fasting as possible. Drinking water is ok and recommended.

5 - Do not start a new exercise routine or do a strenuous workout prior to your test.

6 - Reschedule your test if you suddenly have a poor night’s sleep and this is not a normal issue for you.

7 - Medication and supplement timing is important! If you take a thyroid medication such as Levothyroxine (Synthroid) you should wait to take it until after your thyroid test. Also, the supplement Biotin can disrupt thyroid and testosterone levels on the test and should be avoided for 72 hours prior to your test.

8 - Dehydration affects your testing results. Make sure to drink at least 8 glasses of water daily prior to and the day of your test.

9 - Avoid alcohol consumption 24-48 hours prior to your test.

**Blood testing pro tip** - Because the equipment and testing methods change from lab to lab, it is best to continually get your testing done from the same lab if it is possible. Comparing the results from the same lab will create the most accurate health trends.

## **How to use yearly blood testing to monitor your health**

A blood test is a snapshot in time but you are a dynamic system. So, it is important to monitor your blood regularly and **compare the results each year.**

Understanding your yearly blood work trends are a powerful way to catch the dysfunction of the body in the early stage so that it does not result in a time-consuming and expensive chronic disease. ****

## **How will I know if my blood test is normal?**

Normal and optimal are two VERY different things when it comes to blood tests. Most blood test reference ranges are determined based on the data from the population of people going to that particular lab. The wide reference range for a test represents the average person.

However, these reference ranges are not necessarily a representation of the healthiest population of people. So, you should be **aiming for what research tells are the optimal ranges for each blood test**, not just average.

As an example, here are the optimal vs. normal reference ranges for triglycerides, a part of a cholesterol test:

*The **normal reference range** of fasting triglycerides is **under 150** mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L). However, a triglyceride level of over 100 mg/dL (1.13 mmol/L) may indicate poor blood sugar control and excessive carbohydrate intake in the diet.*

*Research has also shown that levels below 60 mg/dL (0.68 mmol/L) correlate with increased risk for autoimmune disease and immune system dysfunction.*

*So, the sweet spot or the "**optimal range" for triglycerides is between 60-100** mg/dL (0.68-1.13 mmol/L), not just anything under 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) as the lab reference range suggests.*

This is the most important thing to know when it comes to blood testing - **Normal DOES NOT ALWAYS EQUAL healthy.**

Unfortunately, there is not an easy way to determine the optimal range for each individual test without help from a trained health professional. For some tests, it is good to be closer to the middle of the range while for others it is best to be at the top or bottom end of the range.
