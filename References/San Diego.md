Why do I want to move to San Diego?

- Have an amazing gut feeling about the place
- Had several great friends and business mentors there
- Great communities for entrepreneurship, outdoors, dance, and fun
- Amazing weather year round and happy people
- Beach neighborhoods are very walkable with stores, gyms, and bars
- Would live in a tiny studio or shared house because location matters more than price
- Airport is in the middle of city with great flight connectivity (Southwest hub)
- Airport bus to LAX (major hub) to have great options to fly international
- Can Uber to Tijuana airport and fly cheap to any destination in Mexico for 3-day weekend
- Make use of Epic pass easily and attend regional Burns
- Can afford to live in San Diego if I work for Booz Allen or another Defense company

Took a Navy Reserve assignment to San Diego

- Hung out with a great coworker, LCDR Joye
- Felt amazing while driving and hanging out with others
- Reconnected with Zach Zorn, John Somnez, Luiz Hererra, Anna, Mika, Terran
- Made new friends such as Mayer
- Found new communities like Volleyball, Tango del Rey, and Travelers group
