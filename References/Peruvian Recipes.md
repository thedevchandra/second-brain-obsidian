## Ceviche History

According to some historical currents, for more than 2,000 years, at the time of the Mochica culture, a dish was already being prepared in northern Peru that could well have been the origin of the current Peruvian cebiche. It was a stew consisting of fresh fish cooked cold (macerated) in the sour juices of some local fruits called Tumbo since colonial times they began to use lemons and onions brought by the conquerors.
