I'm thrilled to announce that the Generative AI Opportunity Canvas I created as part of my work as a Carnegie Mellon University - Tepper School of Business Generative AI Faculty Fellow is now available as a Miro template!

The tool aims to provide a structured framework for companies exploring and defining use cases and opportunities using Generative AI. Comprising seven blocks, each segment prompts you to populate it with text boxes, links, pictures, or videos to provide depth and insight.

I'd like to extend my gratitude to CMU’s AI Institute for Societal Decision Making (AI-SDM) for their support of my research into workforce development of human-centric AI which also has influenced the creation of this canvas -- especially Rebecca Nugent (not on LinkedIn), Aarti Singh, Cleotilde (Coty) Gonzalez and Norman Gottron.

Ready to unlock Generative AI’s potential for your company or team? Use the template, share, and give it a heart on Miro today to spread the word! 📣
