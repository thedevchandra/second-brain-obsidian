- **Your [Sleep Score](https://ouraring.com/blog/sleep-score/):** *How well did you sleep last night?*
- **Your [Readiness Score](https://ouraring.com/blog/readiness-score/):** *How ready are you for the day?*
- **Your [Activity Score](https://ouraring.com/blog/activity-score/):** *How are you balancing your activity, inactivity, and rest?*

Your scores ranges from 0-100 — telling you, at a glance, the quality of your sleep and if there are elements that you can adjust to meet your goals:

- **85 or higher:** Optimal
- **70-84:** Good, but pay attention
- **Under 70:** Need help

# Your Readiness Contributors

The sum of seven daily Readiness Contributors make up your Readiness Score. Your contributors answer deeper questions about how your body is responding to your lifestyle in three core pillars – **sleep, activity, and body stress.**

- *Sleep: “How is my sleep impacting my Readiness?”*
    - **Sleep:** *“How well did I sleep last night compared to normal?”*
    - **Sleep Balance:** *“Have I been getting enough sleep in the last 2 weeks?”*
- *Activity: “How are my activity patterns impacting my Readiness?”*
    - **Previous Day Activity:** *“Did I balance my activity, inactivity and rest yesterday?”*
    - **Activity Balance:** *“How much load is my body under from my recent activity levels?”*
- *Stress: “Are there signs that my body needs recovery or that I may be getting sick?”*
    - [**Resting Heart Rate:**](https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025588793-Resting-Heart-Rate) *“Was my RHR substantially higher or lower than usual?”*
    - [**HRV Balance:**](https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025441974-Heart-Rate-Variability) *“How has my HRV changed over the past few weeks?”*
    - [**Body Temperature:**](https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025587493-Body-Temperature) *“Is my body temperature higher or substantially lower than usual?”*
    - [**Recovery Index:**](https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057791533-Readiness-Contributors#h_01GTW0ZKFHCHK08SQHFMSKNDTK) *“After my heart rate reached its baseline last night, how many hours of recovery sleep did I get?”*

| Heart Rate Variability (HRV) | Variation in time between consecutive heartbeats, indicating stress-recovery balance. | 44 | 36 | 32 | 31 | 30 | 40-80 ms | Higher HRV is ideal. |
| Respitory Rate | Average number of breaths per minute during sleep. | 16.3 | 16.2 | 16.1 | 15.9 | 16.0 | 12-16 BPM | Rates may increase with illness or stress. |

# Your Sleep Contributors

Your Sleep Score is made up of seven different personalized sleep elements known as Sleep Contributors:

- **Total Sleep:** *“Did you get enough sleep?”*
- **Efficiency:** *“How much of your time in bed did you actually spend sleeping?”*
- **Restfulness:** *“Did you toss and turn?”*
- **REM Sleep:** *“Did you get enough REM sleep?”*
- **Deep Sleep:** *“Did you get enough deep sleep?”*
- **Latency:** *“How quickly did you fall asleep?”*
- **Timing:** *“When are you getting to sleep? Are you going to bed according to your body’s natural circadian rhythm?”*
