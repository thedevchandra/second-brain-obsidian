Here is a list of lessons that I’ve learned through website ownership, in no particular order:

- Using “Content Explorer” can be a very powerful way to find off market website
opportunities...look for websites that seem to be abandoned within the last 6-12 months
- Figure out which days and months are most profitable, and put your focus into these time
periods if your time is limited
- You can outrank a high DR website with a low DR website. I have a 1 DR website that
outranks 70+ DR websites because of better on page SEO and targeted link building. (i.e.
combat a high DR with better content, better specific link building and better on page SEO)
- Deleting or 301 redirecting old content can improve your rankings
- If a page you want to delete has backlinks, then redirect
- If it doesn’t have backlinks, then delete
- I’ve found it’s easiest to write content in a word doc, and then paste it into Wordpress for
formatting
- Pro tip, for some articles I record myself talking about the topic, and then send the files to
be transcribed. Then all you need to do is edit the transcription
- Buy over build when starting out
- Target evergreen niches when possible (i.e. not tech review content)
- Work in batches (i.e., build X links to an article, then let it sit for 2 months, observe what
happens, and then do another round of work accordingly)
- Do as much hands on work as possible (link building, content creation, theme editing, etc) for
the first 12-24 months, then outsource. Your experience will make it easier to hire and work
with subcontractors
- When doing a major website revamp, set up a test server to test the changes on, before rolling
them out to your money site
- Be mindful to not spread yourself too thin (i.e., probably don’t try to tackle 3 niche sites at
once, if 1 is not running on autopilot yet)
- I prefer working with programmers from Eastern Europe, than any other region
- Sometimes it takes money to make money, trust in yourself and in your skills and make the
investment
- Answer every personally written email (excluding guest post and affiliate requests) that comes
in, you never know who you will help or what it will lead to
- Don’t stress about upcoming Google algorithm updates. If you have a quality site that you’ve
cared for, you’ll be fine
- Don’t get overwhelmed by all of the content on YouTube/Google, find an expert or 2 that you
resonate with, and follow their input. Everyone has different tactics that can all work, but
you’ll spend a lot of time trying to learn from everyone...Sam Oh @ Ahrefs on YouTube was
the main person I followed when starting
- Remember, most of the changes/updates that you make will take time before you see any
results
- Take a break for a week or two if you begin to feel burnt out or motivation begins to wane
- Connect all website functions (website login, affiliate accounts, hosting, etc) to a business
dedicated email address, and not to a personal email address...this will make selling the
website much easier
- Use [escrow.com](http://escrow.com/) to protect yourself when not buying or selling through a broker
- Don’t buy a website that uses a PBN
- Consume all of the Ahrefs’s blog content and YouTube content that you can
- On page SEO is important, all of the little on page SEO intricacies matter
- set your image alt text
- sprinkle in long tail keywords
- spend time writing catchy titles
- Using Google ads can be highly effective and affordable to promote upgrade/guide style
content
- Make friends with your affiliate manager if possible, this can help you get better affiliate offers

Random thoughts that you might find helpful....

- Buy a website with a high DR (40+) with the only intent of selling guest posts as
monetization, I’ve never done this but something I’d like to try
- I’m experimenting with rebuilding websites on expired domains, and then will 301 redirect
the site to a money site...Sean Markey turned me onto this tactic
