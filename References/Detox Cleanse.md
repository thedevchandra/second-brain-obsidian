- **Types of Detox**: Engaged in multiple detox programs, specifically targeting heavy metals and gut health. The third type of detox was not specified.
- **Common Basis**: Utilizes an elimination diet as the foundation for all detox types, aiming to remove potential allergens and reduce inflammation to zero. More details on this diet can be found in the provided documentation [1].
- **Daily Meal Plan**:
    - **Medical Food**: Consumed as one of the main meals, this food is in powdered form and is designed to meet high nutritional standards. It is crucial to use specifically formulated medical foods rather than general meal replacements like Soylent, Huel, or Ample. Examples of appropriate medical foods can be found here [2].
    - **Green Drink**: The other main meal consists of a green powder (AG1 is used) combined with a series of potent supplements tailored to the specific detox plan.
- **Supplements**: These are aggressive and can cause significant discomfort during the detox process. Due to their potent nature, it is advised to take these under medical supervision.
- **Post-Detox Experience**: Although the detox process can be challenging, there is a noted improvement in well-being after completion.
- **Documentation and Guidance**: Extensive notes, lists, and schedules pertaining to the detox plans are available in the linked documents and should be reviewed for detailed guidance [3][4][5].

# **[3] Borys Dibrov  - 7 Day Intense**

    1. Dynamic Greens by NutriDyn – Paleo Greens (Designs for Health)
3. **Extra Modulators**
    1. Glutamine Powder (Designs For Health)
    2. Liver Support II (Vital Nutrients)
    3. Testralin (Metagenics)

    2. Krill oil (Protocol For life Krill 1,000)
    3. Vitamin D3 (Metagenics D3 + K2)
    4. Magnesium (tri-mag 300)
    5. Probiotic
5. **Fibers**
    1. Psyllium Husks (Yerba Prima)
    2. Paleo Fiber (Designs For Health)

**Additional Rules:**

1. Unlimited fibrous veggies with unrefined sea salt, butter or olive oil (in moderation) should be consumed with every medical food shake throughout the week.
2. Don’t go hungry. If you are hungry you can, either add more scoops to your shake, eat more vegetables or have more shakes.
3. Feel free to introduce a form of detox during the week. I personally like either castor oil packs on the liver (takes about 2 hours, watch a movie during this time) OR organic coffee enema’s (I know…)
4. If you have access to an infra-red sauna 20-30 minutes per day will help aid detox. Make sure to shower off after you are done.
5. Drink plenty of milk thistle tea and/or dandelion herbal tea to help with liver detox this week, squeeze some lime-juice into it to increase alkalization. You can carry it around with you in a canteen.
6. Lifting, if you choose to lift. Choose 1 or 2 large movements (Deadlift, squat, pullup, bench press, Dips) do 10 sets of 3 reps. Rest about 2 minutes in between each set. This will tell your body to maintain its muscle mass, as well as move lymph around.
