**Operational Risk Management (ORM)** is a process that involves risk assessment to enhance decision-making in complex environments like the military:

1. **Identifying Hazards**: Potential hazards could include enemy forces, difficult terrain, or faulty equipment.
2. **Assessing Hazards**: Each hazard is evaluated based on its probability and consequence.
    1. **Risk = Probability x Consequence**
3. **Making Risk Decisions**: Decide whether to accept the risk or implement controls. The decision balances the risk against the mission's importance and available resources.
4. **Implementing Controls**: Controls mitigate risks. Examples include additional training, equipment checks, or arranging backup support.
5. **Supervising**: Leaders monitor and adjust controls as needed, ensuring everyone follows protocols and manages unexpected hazards.

**Safety Planning** involves putting procedures and controls to reduce the probability and consequences of identified risks. It's a proactive approach to foresee potential issues and plan accordingly to ensure safety.

[**Enterprise Safety Application Management System (ESAMS)**](https://esams.cnic.navy.mil/esams_gen_2/loginesams.aspx) is a web-based DoD tool used for managing safety:

- ESAMS Help Desk at 1-865-693-0048
- **Hazard Identification and Tracking**: Record and monitor unit hazards in ESAMS.
- **Training Management**: Track completed and required safety training for unit members.
- **Inspections and Compliance**: Schedule regular safety inspections and address identified issues.
- **Mishap Reporting**: Use ESAMS for incident reporting to understand causes and prevent recurrence.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review ESAMS data to identify trends and improve safety performance.
