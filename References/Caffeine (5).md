Delay caffeine and ensure proper hydration

- Delay your caffeine intake by 90–120 minutes after waking to help increase alertness and avoid an afternoon crash.
- As a caveat: if exercising first thing in the morning, feel free to drink caffeine before exercise.

Best Coffee Additives

1. **Cinnamon**: Adding a dash of cinnamon can not only improve the flavor but also provide antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. Cinnamon can also help lower blood sugar levels.
2. **Cocoa Powder**: Unsweetened cocoa powder adds a rich chocolate flavor and is packed with antioxidants. It can also improve mood and cognitive function.
3. **Nut Milk**: Almond, soy, oat, or coconut milk are great dairy alternatives that can add creaminess without the saturated fats found in dairy creamers. They also often come fortified with vitamins and minerals.
4. **Coconut Oil or MCT Oil**: These healthy fats can provide a quick energy boost and support brain health. They are popular in bulletproof coffee recipes.
5. **Collagen Peptides**: Adding collagen can improve skin, hair, nail, and joint health. It's tasteless and dissolves easily in hot coffee.
6. **Turmeric**: Known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, a small amount of turmeric can add a unique flavor and health benefits. Consider adding a pinch of black pepper to enhance the absorption of curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric.
7. **Vanilla Extract**: Pure vanilla extract adds a natural sweetness and flavor without the extra calories or sugars.
8. **Honey or Maple Syrup**: If you prefer a bit of sweetness, these natural sweeteners are better alternatives to refined sugar, providing additional vitamins and minerals.
9. **Plant-Based Protein Powder**: For an extra protein boost, consider adding a plant-based protein powder, especially if you enjoy coffee post-workout.
10. **Cardamom**: This spice adds a unique flavor and is known for its digestive and anti-inflammatory benefits.
11. **Ginger**: Freshly grated or powdered ginger can add a spicy kick and is great for digestion and anti-inflammatory purposes.
12. **Butter**: Known as bulletproof coffee, it provides sustained energy, improved mental clarity, and increased satiety.
13. **Mushrooms**: Adding mushrooms (like reishi, chaga, lion's mane, and cordyceps) enhances immune function, reducedsinflammation, improves mental clarity and focus, increases energy, and overall better stress management.
