## **PROCESS:**

1. **Go to [Travel Dashboard.](https://www.notion.so/a12277085eb34eaf801eafaf91270ba0?pvs=21)** 
    - Regularly check the Travel Dashboard, a central location where all planned travels are sorted by date.
2. **Click and check each parent task.** 
    - Make sure all details matched on TripIt Plans.
3. **Fill out the necessary details like general information, flights, and accommodations.** Use the template provided. 
    - **3.1** **Fill out the general information.**
        
        Use this ChatGPT prompt to get the details and copy and paste only what you think is necessary. 
        
        **ChatGPT Prompt:** *I'm planning a vacation to {{location}} from {{start_date}} to {{end_date}} as an American tourist. What are the visa rules (provide specific day rules), weather (provide specific temperatures), safety, immunizations (do not provide routine vaccinations as I am up to date), language, transportation options, cultural norms, and activities (please respond to each inquiry in one bullet point of one concise sentence)?*
        
        It should appear like this:

    - **3.2 Research flights for that travel date.**
        
        Use google search to research flights available. Look for flights that are cost and time saving. We don’t want to pick a cheap flight but with long layover hours and we don’t want a too expensive flight. Save or bookmark the flight details. Send Dev flight options based on your research. 
        
        After flight is booked, put the flight information on Notion
        
    - **3.3 Research transportation routes.**
        
        Use ChatGPT to research how and what mode of transportation will be used to get to a specific location (event place/hotel accommodation) from the airport. Include estimated minutes of travel. 
        
        It should look like this:

    - 3.4 **Research Accommodations**
        
        Use Agoda/AirBnB/Bookings.com to check for hotel accommodations. The location should have a gym and a coworking place or cafe nearby. Research available places to book for those dates and provide dev top 5 options. 
        
        Once Dev had booked the location, verify if the information matched on Notion, TripIt, and calendar.
        
        Check the google maps to find a gym/coworking space/ cafe nearby. 
        
        It should look like this:

4. **Create a subtask under the parent task with “Cancel [hotel accommodation]?”**
    - Navigate to the booking platform used (Agoda, AirBnB, Bookings.com) to review the cancellation policy for the booked accommodation.
    - Set the due date for this subtask based on the cancellation deadline to receive a full refund.
    - Paste the booking confirmation link directly into the subtask description (website URL). This allows for easy access to the booking details if cancellation becomes necessary.
5. Make sure all details in Notion, TripIt and Booking Platforms (Agoda, AirBnB, Bookings.com) used have matching details and date. Do this every Monday for upcoming travels.
