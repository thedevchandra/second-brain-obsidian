Favorite Camps:

- Kashyyyk: Your favorite wookiees are back! Stop by our legendary Wookiee Bodega, open daily from 12-5PM. Modeled after a beloved NYC community bodega, it is a little convenience “store” for trinkets ranging from playa-essential (sunscreen, tampons, reusable water bottles) to ostentatious indulgences (bedazzled jewelry, candy bars, decorative knick-knacks).
- [Partner Dance Adventures](http://pdacamp.com/): We offer thrice-daily lessons in Blues, Tango, and a variety of other partner dances, and we are ready to show you an entirely new side of life to experience and a whole new family that is waiting for you to join us!
- Golden Guy Alley: The Golden Gai area in Tokyo is known for its narrow alleys filled with tiny, eclectic bars, each with its own distinct theme and atmosphere.
- Black Rock Piano Lounge Black Rock Piano Lounge is the place to come and share your talent with a friendly audience. We bring great musicians to the playa but build our lounge for that spontaneous moment where the perfect vocals are combined with the best tuned pianos on the playa. Lets make some beautiful music together
- Ashram Galactica: This camp is a mix of luxurious and absurd. Ashram Galactica is a “luxury” camp where you can experience high tea, swanky cocktails, and even have the chance to win a “night in a luxury suite” on the playa.
- KISS (Keep It Simple Sexy): It is an experiential theme camp and non-profit co-created by a leadership team with backgrounds in experience design, community building and decades combined building theme camps on playa.
- Havana Nights
- Karma Love: Karma Love is a celebration of you, offering body art, wellness experiences, and a sense of community where you’re encouraged to play and connect Share in the communal joy thru dance, gifting, food and body experiences, recognizing that you are indeed the universe, awakened.
- Love Puddle: It is all about creating a warm, inviting space where participants can come together in a "puddle" of love and affection. [http://lovepuddle.net/](http://lovepuddle.net/) [Bernadette@lovepuddle.net](mailto:Bernadette@lovepuddle.net)
