Japan is the land of experiences.  Due to it’s history of frequent earthquakes and tsunamis, few grand historic buildings survive.  Most of the castles, shinto shrines and Bhuddist temples you’ll see are reconstructions.  The best way to enjoy Japan is to jump in and participate in it’s culture, or in other words, do as the Japanese do for a few days while you’re there.

**Top Tokyo and Japan experiences IMHO - Sean**

**Tokyo**

1. Check out Shibuya and Harajuku and nearby Yoyogi Park and Meiji-jingu Shrine
2. Walk around the Ginza (like NY’s 5th Avenue or Chicago’s Miracle Mile). Check out a huge department store like the Mitsukoshi Department Store there or the Takashimaya Times Square complex in Shinjuku. Have a brew and lunch or a snack at the Ginza Lion Beer Hall, one of the few structures in the area that survived U.S. bombing during WWII.
3. Check out a Japanese garden such as **Shinjuku Gyoen Garden** ([Shinjuku](https://trulytokyo.com/shinjuku/)) for some fall leaf peeping or the Imperial Palace East Garden ([Imperial Palace Area](https://trulytokyo.com/tokyo-imperial-palace-and-around/))
4. Attend a baseball game at Tokyo’s Big Egg Dome or Meiji Stadium (my favorite since Yankees Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig played here while on a 22 game tour of Japan in 1934). Season runs from April to October like ours. Japanese baseball fans cheer like American college football fans, maybe even harder. It’s a lot of fun. Buy a draft beer poured straight from a keg at your seat.
5. Visit a temple (Bhuddism) or Shrine (Shintoism) like Senso-ji Temple ([Asakusa](https://trulytokyo.com/asakusa/)) or Asakusa-jinja Shrine ([Asakusa](https://trulytokyo.com/asakusa/))
6. Sumo (tournaments occur 3 times per year in Tokyo and once in Fukuoka at the highest level of the sport)
7. Ride the Yamanote line to get around Tokyo.
8. Eat small plates of food and drink beer and Chu-hai (mixed drink of shochu liquor and juice) at an Izakaya-type restaurant.
9. Visit the Tsukiji fish market at 5AM followed by sushi for breakfast
10. Visit the Golden Gai near Shinjuku for evening karaoke and drinking (not a family friendly activity!)
11. Have a drink at the Park Hyatt in Shinjuku famous from “Lost in Translation” movie (Great views of Tokyo). The bar is in the lobby so this is fairly family friendly.
12. Check out the Edo-Tokyo Museum if you’re curious about what life was like in Tokyo (formerly called Edo) before Japan began to open to the west in the 1860’s.
13. Check out a Japanese jazz club and cocktail bar. Tokyo has the one of the most vibrant jazz scenes outside the U.S.
14. Check the event schedule at the Budokan in Tokyo to see if there may be some martial arts or other cultural events to check out during your visit.

**Near Tokyo**

1. Take a day trip to check out Kamakura and see a thousand year old giant Buddha statue - Kamakura
2. Sightsee/Hike near Fuji-san (not up Fuji-san) - [https://trulytokyo.com/a-day-trip-to-the-mt-fuji-area-lake-kawaguchiko/](https://trulytokyo.com/a-day-trip-to-the-mt-fuji-area-lake-kawaguchiko/). The best views of Mt. Fuji are here.
3. Stay at a Japanese inn (ryokan) with an outdoor rotenburo (natural hot bath also called an onsen). Good spots for this are near Kawaguchiko (see above) or Hakone.

**Non-Location Specific**

1. Cook okonomiyaki at your table
2. Bath in a Japanese bath (onsen) - available in most hotels
3. Cherry blossom viewing in April - people love to eat, drink and sing karaoke under the blossoms while they’re in full bloom
4. Dress up in kimono and take family pictures - getting into and out of the kimono is pretty interesting.
5. Sing Karaoke at any Karaoke joint - you get a private room and they serve food
6. Buy beer from a vending machine
7. Ride a bullet train
8. Various festivals (O-matsuri) occur throughout the year. Check one out! (See JNTO below)
9. View or participate in a Tea ceremony

**Other Cities/Area**

1. Visit Hiroshima - Atomic Bomb Dome and museum. Ride the streetcars.
2. Visit Miyajima Island near Hiroshima which has tame deer and a floating torii gate. It’s considered one of Japan’s “great views"

They’re working hard to make the country more accessible for tourism as they prepare for the Tokyo Summer Olympics in 2020.
