Below is a list of the plugins that I use on my websites, in no particular order. Bolded plugins are
ones that I can not live without. All plugins can be found within the “Plugins” feature on
Wordpress, and do not need to be installed separately.

1. Classic Wordpress Editor - I always install the classic Wordpress editor, as I’ve found it’s
easier to create and edit content with this functionality
2. Link Whisper - Makes internal linking between articles super easy, which is important to
spreading link juice around for SEO
3. Ninja Forms - Easily make forms that users can submit from within the content
4. MailerLite - I use this program to store my email addresses and send my email campaigns,
their plugin also allows you to collect email addresses within your content
5. Open in New Window Plugin - Forces all of your links to open in a new tab
6. Page Scroll to ID - Useful for adding a table of contents, where the user clicks on the section
of the article and the page auto scrolls to it
7. Pretty Links - Easy place to track all of your affiliate links, while changing the URL
extensions to be more attractive
8. Really Simple SSL - Your website probably already has an SSL certificate, but if not use
this plugin
9. Redirection - Use this plugin if you need to 301 redirect any of your pages, this can also be
done within your hosting account to avoid installing another plugin
10. ShortPixel Image Optimizer - This plugin is free, but you purchase credits to make it work.
The plugin optimizes images automatically, while maintaining the image quality, which
increases website speed
11. WP Rocket - This is a paid plugin that offers superior website caching for increased loading
time and page speed
12. Yoast SEO - This was the first SEO plugin for Wordpress and runs on millions of websites,
90% of my sites use this plugin with the other 10% use...
13. RankMath - A modern SEO plugin that offers greater insights when optimizing content
14. Yet Another Stars Rating - If you want to rate a product review piece of content, and have
stars show up in the SERPs, use this plugin
