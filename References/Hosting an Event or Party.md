# **Now, Time for a Platform**

You’ve taken the time to enter and/or create these four different groups, so now you want to take things to the next level by creating a recurring event that will allow these different groups to cross-pollinate in quantities and means that you can control.

AJ emphasizes keeping it easy and simple. If you don’t have a great venue to host the party yourself, find a cool restaurant or bar that will be okay with having a group of you come together for a soiree. Once you’ve come up with a sustainable day/time and location for your platform (e.g., the third Thursday of each month) then you want to invite not just people from all your groups, but any new people you have met as well.

Now you may not want to invite absolutely everyone you meet. Social media can provide you with a bit of background on potential invitees. By taking a quick look at Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, you can glean what they post about on a daily basis, where they spend their time, and even what kind of food or drinks they like. If you see any kind of drama or ongoing negativity in the posts, save everyone a lot of trouble and don’t invite such people.

Ask any of the girls you invite to bring their friends. They may only bring one or two at first, but when they see that you have a vibrant social life, they are going to feel more comfortable bringing more of their social circle along.

# **You’re the Pace Car**

People are going to be looking to you, especially if they have never been to your event, for how to act. So start eating if there’s food set out. Pour yourself a drink if no one is drinking. Mingle. Start introducing people. People will follow your lead. It’s your party, after all.

Being a great host means focusing on the people who took the time to come to your event, not the people who didn’t end up showing. It’s important not to make people feel guilty for missing. Your event needs to be something for which people feel safe showing up whenever they can. People have busy lives and you should take it as a great compliment that they are willing to set aside some of it to spend with you.
