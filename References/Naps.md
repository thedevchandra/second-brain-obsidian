Rest and recharge with naps or non-sleep deep rest (NSDR)

- Try to keep naps to 20 minutes or less to avoid sleep inertia.
- However, if you don’t feel an afternoon dip in energy or you tend to feel groggy after a nap, feel free to avoid them. Naps are not necessary.
- Use a non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) protocol for 10–30 minutes to increase dopamine levels and mental energy 3.

Sleep inertia

- Sleep inertia is the grogginess and disorientation that people feel when they wake up from deep, slow-wave sleep. Napping longer than 20–25 minutes can allow the brain to begin a full sleep cycle.
- Trying to quickly wake up from the middle of a sleep cycle is difficult and can lead to even more fatigue and irritability than when you started your nap.
