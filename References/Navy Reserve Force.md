- **Ready Reserve** – The Ready Reserve provides a pool of trained service members who are ready to step in and serve whenever and wherever needed. It is made up of the Selected Reserve – which includes Drilling Reservists/Units as well as Full-Time Support (FTS)/(TAR) personnel – and the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR).
- **Selected Reserve (SELRES)** – This group – the largest and most relied upon of the Ready Reserve – consists of: Drilling Reservists/Units – These are designated Reservists who are available for recall to Active Duty status. They serve as the Navy’s primary source of immediate manpower. They typically fulfill the traditional service commitment of one weekend a month and two weeks a year. They receive many of the same benefits and perform many of the same duties as their Active Duty counterparts. This includes persons on initial Active Duty for training.
- **Training and Administration of the Reserve (TAR)** (was Full Time Support (FTS)) – These are designated Reservists who perform full-time Active Duty service that relates to the training and administration of the Navy Reserve program. They may be assigned to shore activities and commands or operational units. They typically are not reassigned to different locations as often as those on regular Active Duty. And they receive the same pay, allowances, and benefits as Active Duty members.
- **Individual Ready Reserve (IRR)** – This group consists of individuals who have had training or have previously served in an Active Duty component or the Selected Reserve.
    - **Inactive status** – These members of the IRR do not drill, are not obligated to take part in military activities, and receive no pay or benefits.
    - **Active status** – Individuals assigned to the IRR may be eligible to receive pay or benefits for voluntarily performing specific types of Active Duty (AD) service.
