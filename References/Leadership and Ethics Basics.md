# Ethics and Moral Reasoning

**Leadership** = the ability to guide, inspire, and influence a group towards achieving a common goal. It involves setting a clear vision, motivating team members, managing resources effectively, and making informed decisions.

**Ethical Behavior** = involves acting in ways that are morally right, fair, and honest, in accordance with accepted principles of right and wrong, both personally and professionally.

## Navy Ethics Resources

1. **U.S. Navy Regulations**: This document provides general regulations and policies for all Navy personnel.
2. **Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)**: It sets forth criminal laws applicable to all members of the military.
3. **Navy Ethics Counselor's Guide**: Provides guidance on ethical issues, including conflicts of interest.
4. **Chain of Command**: Senior officers or mentors can offer guidance based on their experience and understanding of ethical standards.
5. **Navy's Judge Advocate General (JAG)**: Can provide legal advice on ethical issues.

**Motivation:**

- Positive motivation involves encouraging desired behaviors through rewards and recognition, fostering a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.
- Negative motivation, on the other hand, discourages undesired behaviors by highlighting potential negative outcomes or consequences.

# Followership

- **Adopting the ideas, decisions, and messages of your superiors as your own when addressing your subordinates:**
    - Maintaining order and effective communication in the military hinges on respecting the chain of command. Following superiors' decisions fosters consistency and unit cohesion. Misalignments can disrupt missions and morale.
    - Disagreements should be handled respectfully, with a focus on mission objectives. Balancing obedience and critical thinking are crucial in the military hierarchy.
- **Anticipating your superior’s needs to help mission effectiveness**
    - Anticipating a superior’s needs enhances mission effectiveness by enabling proactive actions and efficient resource allocation.
    - To support the gaining command, it's important to prepare the Navy Reserve team to integrate smoothly with active-duty personnel.

# Preparing to Lead

- **Self-perception** is vital as it shapes your behavior, decision-making, and interactions with others, but it can sometimes be skewed.
- **Asking for Honest Feedback:**
    - You can ask for feedback from superiors, peers, and subordinates. It's appropriate to ask for feedback regularly, especially after completing tasks or major efforts.
    - No one is ever too senior as subordinates can provide valuable insights into your leadership style, fostering an environment of mutual respect and continuous improvement.
- **Self-Assessment (SA)** is a process where a leader evaluates their own skills, behaviors, and performance. It allows leaders to make better-informed, balanced decisions, mitigate biases, and continuously improve their leadership effectiveness.

**Charge of Command** = outlines the privilege, scope, and standards of command within the Navy: 

- Being selected for command is a significant honor based on performance and trust.
- Command is about preparing for and leading in combat.
- Command will be challenging at times, so be willing to continuously learn and adapt.
- Be relentless in building a culture in the highest character as a tough, relentless team win.
- Integrity in your command is the foundation of your warfighting effectiveness.
- Keep professional competency as the starting point of every day.
- Lead your team in “Get Real, Get Better” behavior and problem solving - our self-assessing, self-correcting, and learning culture.
- Although we a zero-tolerance Navy on key issues, we are not a zero-defect Navy.

- **Competence**: Lane 1 develops operational and warfighting competence. We must become experts at our jobs as we grow. An incompetent leader is a recipe for disaster.
- **Character**: We must continuously strengthen our ability to behave consistently with our core values of honor, courage, and commitment. This keeps us worthy to lead our Sailors.
- **Connections**: Lane 3 develops intellectual and personal connections:
    - Intellectual connections improve competence by sharing mental models, comparing notes, improving our ability to anticipate our teammates’ next move.
    - Personal connections strengthen our character and resilience by building relationships. We share what we experience and seek to understand what’s going on in others’ lives.

# Leadership Theory and Application

- **Lawful orders** are commands given by a superior that are in line with military regulations (UCMJ), rules of engagement, and international and domestic laws.
- **Unlawful orders** are commands that violate military regulations, laws, or ethical standards, including orders that would result in a war crime or other illegal actions. Military personnel have a duty to recognize and refuse to follow unlawful orders.
- **Dealing with Unlawful Orders**: First seek clarification to understand it fully. Then, communication concerns with the issuer, respectfully. Then, escalate it up the chain of command or consult with a JAG.
