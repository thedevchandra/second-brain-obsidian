A counterintuitive approach to living a good life by embracing limitations and choosing what to care about. Manson argues that the key to happiness isn't positive thinking or avoiding problems, but rather choosing which problems are worth solving. Uses blunt humor and real talk to challenge conventional self-help wisdom and advocate for accepting life's struggles.
