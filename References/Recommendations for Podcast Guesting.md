# Transcript

Hello, hello, sir. Yes, good to hear from you, buddy. I'm bummed that I won't be able to make it to Peru, to Machu Picchu. You were going, and then a friend of mine is gonna go to Lima, and then she's gonna do, like, a week in Machu Picchu.

It was really tempting to go for, like, a month, but I decided to stay here in Buenos Aires, and then, and stuff. But yeah, yeah, I'd love to catch up. In terms of podcast guesting, yeah, that's, you know, I'm always recommending it. There's, I would say, in terms of promoting yourself, I would consider going on to Podmatch.

It's a service that I do a little bit with my clients, or recommend to my clients, and stuff. It's, I would say that what you do, it's a monthly service, but you'd, you know, you pay for it. It's like, I don't know, 30 bucks a month, or something like that. And you put your profile, you poke what you want to talk about.

And I wouldn't say that, I wouldn't say out of the gate, it's gonna be a bunch of, you know, big podcasts. But I always suggest, you know, starting somewhere, you know, getting on a couple podcasts, and then you can use that. I think you can set up a Spotify account to show that all the podcasts you've been on. And so, the good part is that you have kind of like a, you know, you're on, you have a couple, you know, practice runs with these smaller podcasts, and then you can start pitching yourself for bigger podcasts.

There's definitely a lot of Facebook groups, too. But it's really about, really the same thing you've always talked about, is like, you know, make sure it's, you're talking about one specific value add. Like, this is what I'm gonna talk about. Sometimes I give, like, two options because I'm pitching clients.

Like, they can talk about this or this. But it's like, this is what we're gonna talk about. This is why your audience would find value in it. And, yeah.
